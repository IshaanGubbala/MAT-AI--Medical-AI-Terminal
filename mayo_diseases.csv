Atrial fibrillation,"Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm. An irregular heart rhythm is called an arrhythmia.AFibcan lead to blood clots in the heart. The condition also increases the risk of stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications.
During atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers — called the atria — beat chaotically and irregularly. They beat out of sync with the lower heart chambers, called the ventricles. For many people,AFibmay have no symptoms. ButAFibmay cause a fast, pounding heartbeat, shortness of breath or light-headedness.
Episodes of atrial fibrillation may come and go, or they may be persistent.AFibitself usually isn't life-threatening. But it's a serious medical condition that needs proper treatment to prevent stroke.
Treatment for atrial fibrillation may include medicines, therapy to shock the heart back to a regular rhythm and procedures to block faulty heart signals.
A person with atrial fibrillation also may have a related heart rhythm problem called atrial flutter. The treatments forAFiband atrial flutter are similar.","Symptoms ofAFibmay include: | Feelings of a fast, fluttering or pounding heartbeat, called palpitations. | Chest pain. | Dizziness. | Fatigue. | Lightheadedness. | Reduced ability to exercise. | Shortness of breath. | Weakness. | Some people with atrial fibrillation (AFib) don't notice any symptoms. | Atrial fibrillation may be: | Occasional, also called paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.AFibsymptoms come and go. The symptoms usually last for a few minutes to hours. Some people have symptoms for as long as a week. The episodes can happen repeatedly. Symptoms might go away on their own. Some people with occasionalAFibneed treatment. | Persistent.The irregular heartbeat is constant. The heart rhythm does not reset on its own. If symptoms occur, medical treatment is needed to correct the heart rhythm. | Long-standing persistent.This type ofAFibis constant and lasts longer than 12 months. Medicines or a procedure are needed to correct the irregular heartbeat. | Permanent.In this type of atrial fibrillation, the irregular heart rhythm can't be reset. Medicines are needed to control the heart rate and to prevent blood clots.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350624
Abdominal aortic aneurysm,"An abdominal aortic aneurysm is an enlarged area in the lower part of the body's main artery, called the aorta. The aorta runs from the heart through the center of the chest and belly area, called the abdomen.
The aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body. An abdominal aortic aneurysm that ruptures can cause life-threatening bleeding.
Treatment depends on the size of the aneurysm and how fast it's growing. Treatment varies from regular health checkups and imaging tests to emergency surgery.","Abdominal aortic aneurysms often grow slowly without noticeable symptoms. This makes them difficult to detect. Some aneurysms never rupture. Many start small and stay small. Others grow larger over time, sometimes quickly. | If you have a growing abdominal aortic aneurysm, you might notice: | Deep, constant pain in the belly area or side of the belly. | Back pain. | A pulse near the bellybutton.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/symptoms-causes/syc-20350688
Hyperhidrosis,"Hyperhidrosis (hi-pur-hi-DROE-sis) is excessive sweating that's not always related to heat or exercise. You may sweat so much that it soaks through your clothes or drips off your hands. Heavy sweating can disrupt your day and cause social anxiety and embarrassment.
Hyperhidrosis treatment usually helps. It often begins with antiperspirants. If these don't help, you may need to try different medications and therapies. In severe cases, your health care provider may suggest surgery to remove the sweat glands or to disconnect the nerves related to producing too much sweat.
Sometimes an underlying condition may be found and treated.","The main symptom of hyperhidrosis is heavy sweating. This goes beyond the sweating from being in a hot environment, exercising, or feeling anxious or stressed. The type of hyperhidrosis that usually affects the hands, feet, underarms or face causes at least one episode a week when you're awake. And the sweating usually happens on both sides of the body.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hyperhidrosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20367152

Absence seizure,"Absence seizures involve brief, sudden lapses of consciousness. They're more common in children than in adults.
A person having an absence seizure may stare blankly into space for a few seconds. Then the person typically returns quickly to being alert. This type of seizure usually doesn't lead to physical injury. But injury can happen if someone is driving a car or riding a bike when the seizure happens.
Absence seizures usually can be managed with antiseizure medicines. Some children who have them also develop other seizures, such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures or myoclonic seizures. Many children outgrow absence seizures in their teens.","A simple absence seizure causes a vacant stare, which may be mistaken for a brief lapse in attention. The seizure lasts about 10 seconds, though it may last as long as 30 seconds. There's no confusion, headache or drowsiness after the seizure. | Symptoms of absence seizures include: | A sudden stop in activity without falling. | Lip smacking. | Eyelid flutters. | Chewing motions. | Finger rubbing. | Small movements of both hands. | Afterward, there's usually no memory of the incident. But if the seizure is longer, the person may be aware of missed time. Some people have many episodes daily. When it happens, it can interfere with school or daily activities. | A child may have absence seizures for some time before an adult notices them. This is because the seizures are so brief. A decline in a child's learning ability may be the first sign of the seizure disorder. Teachers may say the child has trouble paying attention or that a child is often daydreaming.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/petit-mal-seizure/symptoms-causes/syc-20359683

Achilles tendinitis,,,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/achilles-tendinitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20369020
Achilles tendon rupture,"Achilles (uh-KILL-eez) tendon rupture is an injury that affects the back of your lower leg. It mainly occurs in people playing recreational sports, but it can happen to anyone.
The Achilles tendon is a strong fibrous cord that connects the muscles in the back of your calf to your heel bone. If you overstretch your Achilles tendon, it can tear (rupture) completely or just partially.
If your Achilles tendon ruptures, you might hear a pop, followed by an immediate sharp pain in the back of your ankle and lower leg that is likely to affect your ability to walk properly. Surgery is often performed to repair the rupture. For many people, however, nonsurgical treatment works just as well.","Although it's possible to have no signs or symptoms with an Achilles tendon rupture, most people have: | The feeling of having been kicked in the calf | Pain, possibly severe, and swelling near the heel | An inability to bend the foot downward or ""push off"" the injured leg when walking | An inability to stand on the toes on the injured leg | A popping or snapping sound when the injury occurs",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/achilles-tendon-rupture/symptoms-causes/syc-20353234
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD),"Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a condition in which stomach acid repeatedly flows back up into the tube connecting the mouth and stomach, called the esophagus. It's often called GERD for short. This backwash is known as acid reflux, and it can irritate the lining of the esophagus.
Many people experience acid reflux now and then. However, when acid reflux happens repeatedly over time, it can cause GERD.
Most people can manage the discomfort of GERD with lifestyle changes and medicines. And though it's uncommon, some may need surgery to help with symptoms.","Common symptoms of GERD include: | A burning sensation in the chest, often called heartburn. Heartburn usually happens after eating and might be worse at night or while lying down. | Backwash of food or sour liquid in the throat. | Upper belly or chest pain. | Trouble swallowing, called dysphagia. | Sensation of a lump in the throat. | If you have nighttime acid reflux, you also might experience: | An ongoing cough. | Inflammation of the vocal cords, known as laryngitis. | New or worsening asthma.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gerd/symptoms-causes/syc-20361940
Infant reflux,"Infant reflux is when a baby spits up liquid or food. It happens when stomach contents move back up from a baby's stomach into the esophagus. The esophagus is the muscular tube that connects the mouth to the stomach.
Reflux happens in infants many times a day. If your baby is content and growing well, reflux is not a cause for concern. Sometimes called gastroesophageal reflux, also called GER, the condition becomes less common as a baby gets older. It's unusual for infant reflux to continue after age 18 months.
Rarely, infant reflux leads to weight loss or growth that lags behind that of other children of the same age and sex. These symptoms may mean that your baby has a medical issue. This issue could be an allergy, a blockage in the digestive system or gastroesophageal reflux disease, also called GERD. GERD is a form of GER that causes serious health issues.","Most of the time, infant reflux isn't a cause for concern. It's not usual for stomach contents to have enough acid to irritate the throat or esophagus and cause symptoms.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/infant-acid-reflux/symptoms-causes/syc-20351408
ACL injury,"AnACLinjury is a tear or sprain of the anterior cruciate (KROO-she-ate) ligament (ACL) — one of the strong bands of tissue that help connect your thigh bone (femur) to your shinbone (tibia).ACLinjuries most commonly occur during sports that involve sudden stops or changes in direction, jumping and landing — such as soccer, basketball, football and downhill skiing.
Many people hear a pop or feel a ""popping"" sensation in the knee when anACLinjury occurs. Your knee may swell, feel unstable and become too painful to bear weight.
Depending on the severity of yourACLinjury, treatment may include rest and rehabilitation exercises to help you regain strength and stability, or surgery to replace the torn ligament followed by rehabilitation. A proper training program may help reduce the risk of anACLinjury.","Signs and symptoms of anACLinjury usually include: | A loud pop or a ""popping"" sensation in the knee | Severe pain and inability to continue activity | Rapid swelling | Loss of range of motion | A feeling of instability or ""giving way"" with weight bearing",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acl-injury/symptoms-causes/syc-20350738
Acne,"Acne is a skin condition that occurs when your hair follicles become plugged with oil and dead skin cells. It causes whiteheads, blackheads or pimples. Acne is most common among teenagers, though it affects people of all ages.
Effective acne treatments are available, but acne can be persistent. The pimples and bumps heal slowly, and when one begins to go away, others seem to crop up.
Depending on its severity, acne can cause emotional distress and scar the skin. The earlier you start treatment, the lower your risk of such problems.","Acne signs vary depending on the severity of your condition: | Whiteheads (closed plugged pores) | Blackheads (open plugged pores) | Small red, tender bumps (papules) | Pimples (pustules), which are papules with pus at their tips | Large, solid, painful lumps under the skin (nodules) | Painful, pus-filled lumps under the skin (cystic lesions) | Acne usually appears on the face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acne/symptoms-causes/syc-20368047
Hidradenitis suppurativa,"Hidradenitis suppurativa (hi-drad-uh-NIE-tis sup-yoo-ruh-TIE-vuh), also known as acne inversa, is a condition that causes small, painful lumps to form under the skin. The lumps usually develop in areas where your skin rubs together, such as the armpits, groin, buttocks and breasts. The lumps heal slowly, recur, and can lead to tunnels under the skin and scarring.
Hidradenitis suppurativa tends to start after puberty, usually before age 40. It can persist for many years and worsen over time. It can affect your daily life and emotional well-being. Combined medical and surgical therapy can help manage the disease and prevent complications.
Women are three times more likely to develop hidradenitis suppurativa, though this ratio can differ by location around the world. Also, Black people are more likely to develop this disease than people of other races. This could be attributed to genetic factors.","Hidradenitis suppurativa can affect one or several areas of the body. Signs and symptoms of the condition include: | Blackheads.Blackheads appear in small, pitted areas of skin, often appearing in pairs. | Painful pea-sized lumps.The condition usually starts with a single, painful lump under the skin that persists for weeks or months. More bumps may form later, usually in areas where you have more sweat and oil glands or where the skin rubs together, such as the armpits, groin, buttocks and breasts. | Leaking bumps or sores.Some bumps or sores get bigger, break open and drain pus with an odor. | Tunnels.Over time, tunnels might form under the skin, connecting the lumps. These wounds heal slowly, if at all, and drain blood and pus. | Some people with this condition experience only mild symptoms. The course of the disease is highly variable. Excess weight and being a smoker are associated with worse symptoms, but people who are thin and don't smoke can experience severe disease.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hidradenitis-suppurativa/symptoms-causes/syc-20352306
HIV/AIDS,"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is an ongoing, also called chronic, condition. It's caused by the human immunodeficiency virus, also called HIV.HIVdamages the immune system so that the body is less able to fight infection and disease. IfHIVisn't treated, it can take years before it weakens the immune system enough to becomeAIDS. Thanks to treatment, most people in the U.S. don't getAIDS.
HIVis spread through contact with genitals, such as during sex without a condom. This type of infection is called a sexually transmitted infection, also called an STI.HIValso is spread through contact with blood, such as when people share needles or syringes. It is also possible for a person with untreatedHIVto spread the virus to a child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.
There's no cure forHIV/AIDS. But medicines can control the infection and keep the disease from getting worse. Antiviral treatments forHIVhave reducedAIDSdeaths around the world. There's an ongoing effort to make ways to prevent and treatHIV/AIDSmore available in resource-poor countries.",The symptoms ofHIVandAIDSvary depending on the person and the phase of infection.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hiv-aids/symptoms-causes/syc-20373524
Acromegaly,"Acromegaly is a rare condition in adults that causes some bones, organs and other tissue to grow bigger. A small gland in the brain called the pituitary gland drives these changes by making too much growth hormone. This usually happens due to a tumor of the pituitary gland. The tumor isn't cancer.
When the body has too much growth hormone, bones get bigger. In childhood, this leads to increased height as part of a condition called gigantism. In adults with acromegaly, a change in height doesn't happen. Instead, bones in the hands, feet and face become bigger.
These changes happen slowly over many years. So people with acromegaly and their loved ones may take a long time to notice the symptoms. And healthcare professionals may have a hard time finding and treating the condition early on.
Without treatment, acromegaly can lead to other serious and sometimes life-threatening health conditions called complications. But treatments such as surgery, medicine and radiation can lower the risk of complications. Treatment also can improve many acromegaly symptoms.","Acromegaly symptoms can change the way some body parts look. Changes can include: | Thick ears and lips. | A broad nose. | Enlarged hands and feet. | A jutting brow or jaw. | Gaps between teeth. | An enlarged tongue. | An expanded rib cage that may cause the chest to have a round shape. | Skin changes can include: | Acne. | Harmless skin growths called skin tags. | Coarse, oily and thickened skin. | Swelling in the tissue under the skin. | Most often, people with acromegaly don't have every possible body change. And because the changes come on slowly, they may take years to notice. But over time, rings may no longer fit fingers like they used to. Or shoe size may get bigger. Sometimes, people notice the changes only by comparing old photos with newer ones. | Other acromegaly symptoms can include: | Vision troubles, including loss of side vision. | More sweating and body odor than is typical. | Extreme tiredness. | Headaches. | Joint pain. | Deeper voice.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acromegaly/symptoms-causes/syc-20351222

Acute coronary syndrome,"Acute coronary syndrome is a term that describes a range of conditions related to sudden, reduced blood flow to the heart. These conditions include a heart attack and unstable angina.
A heart attack happens when cell death damages or destroys heart tissue. A heart attack also is known as a myocardial infarction.
Unstable angina occurs when blood flow to the heart decreases. It's not severe enough to cause cell death or a heart attack. But the reduced blood flow may increase your risk of a heart attack.
Acute coronary syndrome often causes severe chest pain or discomfort. It is a medical emergency that needs a diagnosis and care right away. The goals of treatment include improving blood flow, treating complications and preventing future problems.","The symptoms of acute coronary syndrome usually begin suddenly. They include: | Chest pain or discomfort. This is often described as aching, pressure, tightness or burning. Chest pain also is called angina. | Pain that starts in the chest and spreads to other parts of the body. These areas include the shoulders, arms, upper belly area, back, neck or jaw. | Nausea or vomiting. | Indigestion. | Shortness of breath, also called dyspnea. | Sudden, heavy sweating. | Racing heartbeat. | Feeling lightheaded or dizzy. | Fainting. | Unusual fatigue. | Chest pain or discomfort is the most common symptom. But symptoms may vary quite a bit depending on your age, sex and other medical conditions. You're more likely to have symptoms without chest pain or discomfort if you're a woman, an older adult or have diabetes.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-coronary-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20352136
Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM),,,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-flaccid-myelitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20493046
Acute myelogenous leukemia,"Acute myelogenous leukemia, also called AML, is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Bone marrow is the soft matter inside bones where blood cells are made.
The word ""acute"" in acute myelogenous leukemia means the disease tends to get worse quickly. It's called myelogenous (my-uh-LOHJ-uh-nus) leukemia because it affects cells called the myeloid cells. These typically develop into mature blood cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.
AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. The other type is acute lymphoblastic leukemia, also called ALL. Although AML can be diagnosed at any age, it is less common before age 45. AML also is called acute myeloid leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, acute granulocytic leukemia and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.
Unlike other cancers, there are no numbered stages of acute myelogenous leukemia.","Symptoms of acute myelogenous leukemia may include: | Fever. | Pain. Common places for pain include the bones, back and stomach. | Feeling very tired. | Paleness or change in skin color. | Frequent infections. | Easy bruising. | Bleeding with no clear cause, such as in the nose or gums. | Shortness of breath.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-myelogenous-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369109
Guillain-Barre syndrome,"Guillain-Barre (gee-YAH-buh-RAY) syndrome is a condition in which the body's immune system attacks the nerves. It can cause weakness, numbness or paralysis.
Weakness and tingling in the hands and feet are usually the first symptoms. These sensations can quickly spread and may lead to paralysis. In its most serious form, Guillain-Barre syndrome is a medical emergency. Most people with the condition need treatment in a hospital.
Guillain-Barre syndrome is rare, and the exact cause is not known. But two-thirds of people have symptoms of an infection in the six weeks before Guillain-Barre symptoms begin. Infections can include a respiratory or a gastrointestinal infection, includingCOVID-19. Guillain-Barre also can be caused by the Zika virus.
There's no known cure for Guillain-Barre syndrome. Several treatment options can ease symptoms and help speed recovery. Most people recover completely from Guillain-Barre syndrome, but some serious illnesses can be fatal. While recovery may take up to several years, most people are able to walk again six months after symptoms first began. Some people may have lasting effects, such as weakness, numbness or fatigue.","Guillain-Barre syndrome often begins with tingling and weakness starting in the feet and legs and spreading to the upper body and arms. Some people notice the first symptoms in the arms or face. As Guillain-Barre syndrome progresses, muscle weakness can turn into paralysis. | Symptoms of Guillain-Barre syndrome may include: | A pins and needles feeling in the fingers, toes, ankles or wrists. | Weakness in the legs that spreads to the upper body. | Unsteady walk or not being able to walk or climb stairs. | Trouble with facial movements, including speaking, chewing or swallowing. | Double vision or inability to move the eyes. | Severe pain that may feel achy, shooting or cramplike and may be worse at night. | Trouble with bladder control or bowel function. | Rapid heart rate. | Low or high blood pressure. | Trouble breathing. | People with Guillain-Barre syndrome usually experience their most significant weakness within two weeks after symptoms begin.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/guillain-barre-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20362793
Acute kidney injury,"Acute kidney injury happens when the kidneys suddenly can't filter waste products from the blood. When the kidneys can't filter wastes, harmful levels of wastes may build up. The blood's chemical makeup may get out of balance.
Acute kidney injury used to be called acute kidney failure. Acute kidney injury is most common in people who are in the hospital, mostly in people who need intensive care.
Acute kidney injury ranges from mild to severe. If severe, ongoing and not treated, it can be fatal. But it also can be reversed. People in otherwise good health may get back typical or nearly typical use of their kidneys.","Symptoms of acute kidney injury may include: | Less urine output. | Fluid buildup, which can cause shortness of breath and swelling in the legs, ankles or feet. | Tiredness. | Confusion or fogginess. | Nausea. | Pain in the belly or in the side below the rib cage. | Weakness. | Irregular heartbeat. | Itching. | Loss of appetite. | Chest pain or pressure. | Seizures or coma in severe cases. | Sometimes acute kidney injury causes no symptoms. Then it may be found through lab tests done for something else.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20369048
Acute liver failure,"Acute liver failure is loss of liver function that happens quickly — in days or weeks — usually in a person who has no preexisting liver disease. It's most often caused by a hepatitis virus or drugs, such as acetaminophen. Acute liver failure is less common than chronic liver failure, which develops more slowly.
Acute liver failure, also known as fulminant hepatic failure, can cause serious complications, including bleeding and increased pressure in the brain. It's a medical emergency that requires hospitalization.
Depending on the cause, acute liver failure can sometimes be reversed with treatment. In many situations, though, a liver transplant may be the only cure.","Symptoms of acute liver failure may include: | Yellowing of the skin and eyeballs, called jaundice. | Pain in the upper right belly area, called the abdomen. | A swollen belly, known as ascites. | Nausea and vomiting. | A general sense of feeling unwell, known as malaise. | Disorientation or confusion. | Sleepiness. | Breath with a musty or sweet odor. | Tremors.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-liver-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20352863
Acute lymphocytic leukemia,"Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow — the spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are made.
The word ""acute"" in acute lymphocytic leukemia comes from the fact that the disease progresses rapidly and creates immature blood cells, rather than mature ones. The word ""lymphocytic"" in acute lymphocytic leukemia refers to the white blood cells called lymphocytes, whichALLaffects. Acute lymphocytic leukemia is also known as acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Acute lymphocytic leukemia is the most common type of cancer in children, and treatments result in a good chance for a cure. Acute lymphocytic leukemia can also occur in adults, though the chance of a cure is greatly reduced.","Signs and symptoms of acute lymphocytic leukemia may include: | Bleeding from the gums | Bone pain | Fever | Frequent infections | Frequent or severe nosebleeds | Lumps caused by swollen lymph nodes in and around the neck, armpits, abdomen or groin | Pale skin | Shortness of breath | Weakness, fatigue or a general decrease in energy",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-lymphocytic-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369077
Radiation sickness,"Radiation sickness is damage to the body caused by a large dose of radiation often received over a short time. This is called acute radiation sickness. The amount of radiation absorbed by the body, called the absorbed dose, determines how bad the illness will be.
Radiation sickness also is called acute radiation syndrome or radiation poisoning. Radiation sickness is not caused by common medical imaging tests that use low-dose radiation, such as X-rays, CT scans and nuclear medicine scans.
Although radiation sickness is serious and often fatal, it's rare. Since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, during World War II, most cases of radiation sickness have occurred after nuclear industrial accidents, such as the 1986 fire that damaged the nuclear power plant at Chernobyl, Ukraine.","The severity of radiation sickness symptoms depends on how much radiation you've absorbed. How much you absorb depends on the strength of the radiated energy, the time of your exposures, and the distance between you and the source of radiation. | Symptoms also are affected by the type of exposure, such as total or partial body. The severity of radiation sickness also depends on how sensitive the affected tissue is. For instance, the gastrointestinal system and bone marrow are highly sensitive to radiation.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/radiation-sickness/symptoms-causes/syc-20377058
ARDS,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs when lung swelling causes fluid to build up in the tiny elastic air sacs in the lungs. These air sacs, called alveoli, have a protective membrane, but lung swelling damages that membrane. The fluid leaking into the air sacs keeps the lungs from filling with enough air. This means less oxygen reaches the bloodstream, so the body's organs don't get the oxygen they need to work properly.
ARDS usually occurs in people who are already critically ill or have major injuries. People usually are severely short of breath — the main symptom of ARDS — within a few hours to a few days after the injury or infection that caused ARDS.
Many people who get ARDS don't survive. The risk of death gets higher with age and how severe the illness is. Of the people who survive ARDS, some fully recover. But others have lasting lung damage.",The seriousness of ARDS symptoms can vary depending on what's causing them and whether there is underlying heart or lung disease. Symptoms include: | Severe shortness of breath. | Labored and rapid breathing that is not usual. | Cough. | Chest discomfort. | Fast heart rate. | Confusion and extreme tiredness.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ards/symptoms-causes/syc-20355576
Acute sinusitis,"Acute sinusitis causes the spaces inside the nose, known as sinuses, to become inflamed and swollen. Acute sinusitis makes it hard for the sinuses to drain. Mucus builds up.
Acute sinusitis can make it hard to breathe through the nose. The area around the eyes and the face might feel swollen. There might be throbbing face pain or a headache.
The common cold is the usual cause of acute sinusitis. Most often, the condition clears up within a week to 10 days unless there's also an infection caused by bacteria, called a bacterial infection. Home remedies might be all that's needed to treat acute sinusitis. Sinusitis that lasts more than 12 weeks even with medical treatment is called chronic sinusitis.","Acute sinusitis symptoms often include: | Thick, yellow or greenish mucus from the nose, known as a runny nose, or down the back of the throat, known as postnasal drip. | Blocked or stuffy nose, known as congestion. This makes it hard to breathe through the nose. | Pain, tenderness, swelling and pressure around the eyes, cheeks, nose or forehead that gets worse when bending over. | Other signs and symptoms include: | Ear pressure. | Headache. | Aching in the teeth. | Changed sense of smell. | Cough. | Bad breath. | Tiredness. | Fever.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-sinusitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351671
Alcohol use disorder,"Alcohol use disorder is a pattern of alcohol use that involves problems controlling your drinking, being preoccupied with alcohol or continuing to use alcohol even when it causes problems. This disorder also involves having to drink more to get the same effect or having withdrawal symptoms when you rapidly decrease or stop drinking. Alcohol use disorder includes a level of drinking that's sometimes called alcoholism.
Unhealthy alcohol use includes any alcohol use that puts your health or safety at risk or causes other alcohol-related problems. It also includes binge drinking — a pattern of drinking where a male has five or more drinks within two hours or a female has at least four drinks within two hours. Binge drinking causes significant health and safety risks.
If your pattern of drinking results in repeated significant distress and problems functioning in your daily life, you likely have alcohol use disorder. It can range from mild to severe. However, even a mild disorder can escalate and lead to serious problems, so early treatment is important.","Alcohol use disorder can be mild, moderate or severe, based on the number of symptoms you experience. Signs and symptoms may include: | Being unable to limit the amount of alcohol you drink | Wanting to cut down on how much you drink or making unsuccessful attempts to do so | Spending a lot of time drinking, getting alcohol or recovering from alcohol use | Feeling a strong craving or urge to drink alcohol | Failing to fulfill major obligations at work, school or home due to repeated alcohol use | Continuing to drink alcohol even though you know it's causing physical, social, work or relationship problems | Giving up or reducing social and work activities and hobbies to use alcohol | Using alcohol in situations where it's not safe, such as when driving or swimming | Developing a tolerance to alcohol so you need more to feel its effect or you have a reduced effect from the same amount | Experiencing withdrawal symptoms — such as nausea, sweating and shaking — when you don't drink, or drinking to avoid these symptoms | Alcohol use disorder can include periods of being drunk (alcohol intoxication) and symptoms of withdrawal. | Alcohol intoxicationresults as the amount of alcohol in your bloodstream increases. The higher the blood alcohol concentration is, the more likely you are to have bad effects. Alcohol intoxication causes behavior problems and mental changes. These may include inappropriate behavior, unstable moods, poor judgment, slurred speech, problems with attention or memory, and poor coordination. You can also have periods called ""blackouts,"" where you don't remember events. Very high blood alcohol levels can lead to coma, permanent brain damage or even death. | Alcohol withdrawalcan occur when alcohol use has been heavy and prolonged and is then stopped or greatly reduced. It can occur within several hours to 4 to 5 days later. Signs and symptoms include sweating, rapid heartbeat, hand tremors, problems sleeping, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, restlessness and agitation, anxiety, and occasionally seizures. Symptoms can be severe enough to impair your ability to function at work or in social situations.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcohol-use-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20369243

Ask your doctor for help.","For some people, using any amount of tobacco can quickly lead to nicotine dependence. Signs that you may be addicted include: | You can't stop smoking.You've made one or more serious, but unsuccessful, attempts to stop. | You have withdrawal symptoms when you try to stop.Your attempts at stopping have caused physical and mood-related symptoms, such as strong cravings, anxiety, irritability, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, depressed mood, frustration, anger, increased hunger, insomnia, constipation or diarrhea. | You keep smoking despite health problems.Even though you've developed health problems with your lungs or your heart, you haven't been able to stop. | You give up social activities.You may stop going to smoke-free restaurants or stop socializing with family or friends because you can't smoke in these situations.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nicotine-dependence/symptoms-causes/syc-20351584
Addison's disease,"Addison's disease is a rare condition that happens when the body doesn't make enough of some hormones. Another name for Addison's disease is primary adrenal insufficiency. With Addison's disease, the adrenal glands make too little of the hormone cortisol. Often, they also make too little of another hormone called aldosterone.
Damage to the adrenal glands causes Addison's disease. Symptoms can start slowly. Early symptoms may include extreme tiredness, salt cravings and weight loss.
Addison's disease can affect anyone. Without treatment, it can be life-threatening. Treatment involves taking lab-made hormones to replace those that are missing.","Addison's disease symptoms usually happen slowly, often over months. The disease may happen so slowly that people who have it might ignore the symptoms at first. Physical stress such as an illness or injury can make symptoms get worse fast. | Early symptoms of Addison's disease can affect you in various ways. Some early symptoms can cause discomfort or loss of energy, including: | Extreme tiredness, also called fatigue. | Dizziness or fainting when standing after sitting or lying down. This is due to a type of low blood pressure called postural hypotension. | Sweating due to low blood sugar, also called hypoglycemia. | Upset stomach, diarrhea or vomiting. | Pain in the stomach area, also called the abdomen. | Muscle cramps, weakness, widespread pain or joint pain. | Other early symptoms can cause changes in how you look, such as: | Body hair loss. | Areas of darkened skin, especially on scars and moles. These changes may be harder to see on Black or brown skin. | Weight loss due to less hunger. | Early Addison's disease symptoms also can affect emotions, mental health and desires.

Mesenteric lymphadenitis,"Lymphadenitis is a condition in which the small round or bean-shaped clusters of cells, called lymph nodes, become swollen and inflamed. The swelling can affect the lymph nodes in the membrane that connects the bowel to the wall around the stomach area, called the mesentery. Then the condition is called mesenteric lymphadenitis (mez-un-TER-ik lim-fad-uh-NIE-tis).
An infection in the intestines, such as a virus, is the usual cause of mesenteric lymphadenitis. Also called mesenteric adenitis, the condition mainly affects children and teens.
Mesenteric lymphadenitis can act like appendicitis or a condition in which part of the intestine slides into another part of the intestine, called intussusception. Unlike appendicitis or intussusception, mesenteric lymphadenitis usually clears up on its own.","Possible symptoms of mesenteric lymphadenitis include: | Pain in the stomach area, often on the lower right side, but the pain can be more spread out. | General tenderness of the stomach area. | Fever. | Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. | Depending on what's causing the condition, symptoms also might include: | Diarrhea. | Nausea and vomiting.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mesenteric-lymphadenitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353799

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, also called ADHD, is a long-term condition that affects millions of children. It often continues into adulthood. ADHD includes a mix of ongoing problems. These can include having a hard time paying attention, being hyperactive and being impulsive.
Children with ADHD also may have low self-esteem and troubled relationships and do poorly in school. Symptoms sometimes lessen with age. Some people never completely outgrow their ADHD symptoms but they can learn strategies to be successful.
While treatment won't cure ADHD, it can help a great deal with symptoms. Besides giving education about ADHD, treatment can involve medicines and behavior therapies. Early diagnosis and treatment can make a big difference in results.","The main features of ADHD include not paying attention and being hyperactive and impulsive. ADHD symptoms usually start before age 12. In some children, they can be seen as early as 3 years of age. ADHD symptoms can be mild, moderate or severe. Symptoms need to be seen in two or more settings, such as at home and at school. The symptoms cause problems with development and daily life and may continue into adulthood. | ADHD occurs more often in boys than in girls. Behaviors can be different in boys and girls. For example, boys may be more hyperactive and girls may tend to quietly not pay attention. | There are three types of ADHD: | Predominately inattentive.In this type, most symptoms fall under inattention. This means having trouble focusing and staying on a task. It also includes trouble getting and staying organized. | Predominately hyperactive and impulsive.In this type, most symptoms involve being hyperactive and impulsive. Hyperactive means being too active and having too much energy. It may include disruptive behavior. Being impulsive means acting without thinking ahead about the results or effects of behavior. | Combined.This type is a mix of inattentive symptoms and hyperactive and impulsive symptoms. The person meets the criteria for both predominately inattentive and predominately hyperactive and impulsive types of ADHD.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adhd/symptoms-causes/syc-20350889
Adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),"Adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a mental health disorder that includes a combination of persistent problems, such as difficulty paying attention, hyperactivity and impulsive behavior. AdultADHDcan lead to unstable relationships, poor work or school performance, low self-esteem, and other problems.
Though it's called adultADHD, symptoms start in early childhood and continue into adulthood. In some cases,ADHDis not recognized or diagnosed until the person is an adult. AdultADHDsymptoms may not be as clear asADHDsymptoms in children. In adults, hyperactivity may decrease, but struggles with impulsiveness, restlessness and difficulty paying attention may continue.
Treatment for adultADHDis similar to treatment for childhoodADHD. AdultADHDtreatment includes medications, psychological counseling (psychotherapy) and treatment for any mental health conditions that occur along withADHD.","Some people withADHDhave fewer symptoms as they age, but some adults continue to have major symptoms that interfere with daily functioning.

Frozen shoulder,"Frozen shoulder, also called adhesive capsulitis, involves stiffness and pain in the shoulder joint. Signs and symptoms typically begin slowly, then get worse. Over time, symptoms get better, usually within 1 to 3 years.
Having to keep a shoulder still for a long period increases the risk of developing frozen shoulder. This might happen after having surgery or breaking an arm.
Treatment for frozen shoulder involves range-of-motion exercises. Sometimes treatment involves corticosteroids and numbing medications injected into the joint. Rarely, arthroscopic surgery is needed to loosen the joint capsule so that it can move more freely.
It's unusual for frozen shoulder to recur in the same shoulder. But some people can develop it in the other shoulder, usually within five years.","Frozen shoulder typically develops slowly in three stages. | Freezing stage.Any movement of the shoulder causes pain, and the shoulder's ability to move becomes limited. This stage lasts from 2 to 9 months. | Frozen stage.Pain might lessen during this stage. However, the shoulder becomes stiffer. Using it becomes more difficult. This stage lasts from 4 to 12 months. | Thawing stage.The shoulder's ability to move begins to improve. This stage lasts from 5 to 24 months. | For some people, the pain worsens at night, sometimes disrupting sleep.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/frozen-shoulder/symptoms-causes/syc-20372684
Adjustment disorders,"Adjustment disorders are excessive reactions to stress that involve negative thoughts, strong emotions and changes in behavior. The reaction to a stressful change or event is much more intense than would typically be expected. This can cause a lot of problems in getting along with others, as well as at work or school.
Work problems, going away to school, an illness or any number of life changes can cause stress. Most of the time, people get used to such changes within a few months. But if you have an adjustment disorder, you continue to have emotional or behavioral responses that can make you feel more anxious or depressed.
Treatment can help you regain your emotional well-being.","Symptoms depend on the type of adjustment disorder. These symptoms can vary from person to person. You experience more stress than would generally be expected in response to a trying event, and this stress causes a lot of problems in your life. | Adjustment disorders affect how you feel and think about yourself and the world. They also may affect your actions or behavior. | Some examples include: | Feeling sad, hopeless or not enjoying things you used to enjoy. | Crying often. | Worrying, or feeling anxious, nervous, jittery or stressed out. | Feeling irritable or like you can't handle anything and don't know where to start. | Having trouble sleeping. | Not eating enough. | Having difficulty concentrating. | Having difficulty with daily activities. | Withdrawing from family and friends who support you socially. | Not doing important things, such as going to work or paying bills. | Thinking about suicide or acting on those thoughts. | Symptoms of an adjustment disorder start within three months of a stressful event. These symptoms last no longer than six months after the end of the stressful event. But constant or lasting adjustment disorders can continue for more than six months. This is especially true if the stressful event is ongoing, such as being unemployed.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adjustment-disorders/symptoms-causes/syc-20355224

Adnexal tumors and masses happen in the:
Diagnosis of adnexal tumors and masses involves a careful physical exam, imaging tests and blood tests. Treatment depends on the size of the tumor or mass and its cause.","Many adnexal tumors and masses don't cause symptoms. They're often found during a medical exam that's done for another reason. | When adnexal tumors and masses cause symptoms, the symptoms may include: | Pain, including pain in the pelvis or belly, painful period cramps that are worse than usual, and painful sex. | A feeling of fullness or pressure in the pelvis or belly, or feeling full quickly when eating. | Nausea and vomiting. | Constipation or bloating. | Urinating a lot or having trouble urinating. | Bleeding from the vagina that is out of the ordinary. | Fever.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adnexal-tumors/symptoms-causes/syc-20355053
Childhood schizophrenia,"Childhood schizophrenia is an uncommon but severe mental disorder in which children and teenagers interpret reality abnormally. Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking (cognitive), behavior or emotions. It may result in some combination of hallucinations, delusions, and extremely disordered thinking and behavior that impairs your child's ability to function.
Childhood schizophrenia is essentially the same as schizophrenia in adults, but it starts early in life — generally in the teenage years — and has a profound impact on a child's behavior and development. With childhood schizophrenia, the early age of onset presents special challenges for diagnosis, treatment, education, and emotional and social development.
Schizophrenia is a chronic condition that requires lifelong treatment. Identifying and starting treatment for childhood schizophrenia as early as possible may significantly improve your child's long-term outcome.","Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking, behavior or emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. The effect can be disabling. | In most people with schizophrenia, symptoms generally start in the mid- to late 20s, though it can start later, up to the mid-30s. Schizophrenia is considered early onset when it starts before the age of 18. Onset of schizophrenia in children younger than age 13 is extremely rare. | Symptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with periods of worsening and remission of symptoms. Some symptoms may always be present. Schizophrenia can be difficult to recognize in the early phases.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/childhood-schizophrenia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354483
Adrenal cancer,"Adrenal cancer is a growth of cells that starts in an adrenal gland. The adrenal glands are small, triangular glands located on top of the kidneys. Although small, these glands control much of what happens in the body. They make hormones that help control metabolism, blood pressure and other important functions.
Adrenal cancer is rare, and it can happen at any age. It's most likely to affect children younger than 5 and adults in their 40s and 50s. Adrenal cancer also is called adrenocortical carcinoma.
When adrenal cancer is found early, a cure may be possible. When the cancer has spread beyond the adrenal glands, a cure becomes less likely. In that situation, treatment may be used to keep the cancer from spreading more.
Most growths that form in the adrenal glands are not cancer. The medical term for that is benign. An example of an adrenal growth that is not cancer is adrenal adenoma.","Signs and symptoms of adrenal cancer may include: | Back pain. | Belly pain. | Losing weight without trying. | Loss of appetite. | Many people who have adrenal cancer develop hormone changes in the body. These changes can happen if the cancer cells make extra hormones. Most often, the adrenal cancer makes the hormone cortisol. This can cause symptoms of Cushing syndrome, including: | Weight gain. | Muscle weakness. | Pink or purple stretch marks on the skin. | Bruises that happen even with a small injury. | High blood pressure. | High blood sugar or diabetes. | Less often, an adrenal cancer might make the sex hormones estrogen and testosterone. In females, changes in the sex hormones can cause extra facial hair, hair loss on the head and periods that aren't regular. In males, these hormone changes may cause the testicles to shrink and breast tissue to get bigger. | Rarely, adrenal cancer may make the hormone aldosterone. That can cause high blood pressure and low levels of potassium in the blood.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adrenal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20351026
Benign adrenal tumors,"Benign adrenal tumors are masses that aren't cancer. They form in the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are part of the endocrine system. These glands make hormones that send messages to nearly every organ and tissue in the body.
There are two adrenal glands, one above each kidney. Each gland has two types of tissue: the cortex and the medulla. Benign adrenal tumors that grow in the cortex are called adrenal adenomas. Those that grow in the medulla are called pheochromocytomas (fee-o-kroe-moe-sy-TOE-muhs).
Most benign adrenal tumors cause no symptoms and don't need treatment. But sometimes these tumors make high levels of some hormones that can cause problems. Hormones from the cortex control metabolism, blood pressure and certain body features, such as hair growth. Hormones from the medulla control the body's response to stress.","Symptoms depend on whether the tumor makes hormones, what hormone it makes and how much it makes. But many benign adrenal gland tumors don't cause symptoms because they don't make hormones. | The most common type of benign adrenal tumor, called adenoma, comes from the adrenal cortex. This type of tumor might cause symptoms such as: | Weight gain. | Easy bruising. | High blood pressure, also called hypertension. | Diabetes. | Depressed mood. | Tiredness. | Muscle weakness or cramping. | A type of benign adrenal tumor from the medulla is called pheochromocytoma. It might cause the following symptoms: | High blood pressure, also called hypertension. | Fast heartbeat. | Sweating. | Tremors. | Headache.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/benign-adrenal-tumors/symptoms-causes/syc-20356190

Adult Still disease,"Adult Still disease is a rare type of inflammatory arthritis. Common symptoms are fevers, rash and joint pain. The condition can occur in some people as a single episode that goes away. In other people, the condition doesn't go away, or it goes away but comes back.
Adult Still disease can damage joints, particularly the wrists. Treatment involves medicine to reduce pain and help control the disease. Prednisone is often used if pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) are not enough.","Most people with adult Still disease have a combination of the following symptoms: | Fever.Fever may rise to at least 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.9 degrees Celsius). The fever may spike once or twice a day for a week or longer. | Rash.A rash might come and go with the fever. The rash usually appears on the trunk, arms or legs. | Sore throat.This is one of the first symptoms of adult Still disease. The lymph nodes in the neck might be swollen and tender. | Achy and swollen joints.Joints — especially in the knees and wrists— might be stiff, painful and inflamed. Ankles, elbows, hands and shoulders also might ache. The joint discomfort usually lasts at least two weeks. | Muscle pain.Muscular pain usually comes and goes with the fever. The pain can be severe enough to disrupt daily activities. | Symptoms of this disorder can differ from person to person.

Autoimmune encephalitis,"Autoimmune encephalitis (en-sef-uh-LIE-tis) is a group of conditions that causes swelling in the brain. This happens because the immune system mistakenly attacks brain cells. Autoimmune encephalitis symptoms can vary but may include memory loss, changes in thinking, changes in behavior and seizures.
Autoimmune encephalitis is different from encephalitis caused by viral or bacterial infections, known as infectious encephalitis. Infectious encephalitis isn't caused by an immune reaction, and it's treated with different medicines. Research has found that the number of people with autoimmune encephalitis is comparable to the number of people with infectious encephalitis.
Experts don't know what causes autoimmune encephalitis, also known as AE. For some people, AE is triggered by certain cancers or infections. Autoimmune encephalitis also may be triggered by medicines. People with an autoimmune disease or a family history of autoimmune disease may be more likely to get AE. Healthcare professionals use several tests to diagnose autoimmune encephalitis.
Without treatment, autoimmune encephalitis can cause serious complications, including death. But treatments can lead to recovery. Many people with AE make a full recovery, but some can have lasting symptoms.","Autoimmune encephalitis symptoms can vary from person to person. But symptoms can occur in a pattern that is predictable depending on the type of autoimmune encephalitis. Many people have a headache, fever and other symptoms of an infection followed by: | Psychiatric symptoms that may include anxiety, panic attacks, changes in behavior, agitation, hallucinations, delusions and trouble organizing thoughts. | Trouble with memory. | Trouble with language, such as talking less or repeating words or phrases. | Movements that are not voluntary. | Seizures. | Changes in consciousness. | Less sleep at the beginning of the disease followed by excess sleep during recovery. | Sometimes AE causes serious seizures that need emergency care, known as status epilepticus. These seizures last more than five minutes or occur one after another while the person is not conscious. | Autoimmune encephalitis symptoms can get worse over time. This disease course is known as progressive. Symptoms also might alternate between getting better and getting worse. This course is known as relapsing-remitting.

Dry macular degeneration,"Dry macular degeneration is an eye condition that causes blurred vision or reduced central vision. It is caused by the breakdown of a part of the retina known as the macula (MAK-u-luh). The macula is responsible for central vision. This condition is common among people over 50.
Dry macular degeneration may start in one eye then develop in the other eye. It also may develop in both eyes at the same time. Over time, vision may worsen and affect the ability to do things, such as read, drive and recognize faces. But having dry macular degeneration doesn't mean you'll lose all your sight. Vision loss is typically central, and people retain their side vision. Some people have only mild central vision loss. In others, it can be more severe.
Early detection and self-care measures may delay vision loss caused by dry macular degeneration.","Dry macular degeneration symptoms usually develop gradually and without pain. They may include: | Visual distortions, such as straight lines seeming bent. | Reduced central vision in one or both eyes. | The need for brighter light when reading or doing close-up work. | Increased difficulty adapting to low light levels, such as when entering a dimly lit restaurant or theater. | Increased blurriness of printed words. | Difficulty recognizing faces. | A well-defined blurry spot or blind spot in the field of vision. | Dry macular degeneration can affect one or both eyes. If only one eye is affected, you may not notice any changes in your vision. This is because your good eye may compensate for the affected eye. And the condition doesn't affect the side vision, so it does not cause total blindness. | Dry macular degeneration is one of two types of age-related macular degeneration. It can progress to wet macular degeneration, which is when blood vessels grow and leak under the retina. The dry type is more common, but it usually progresses slowly over years. The wet type is more likely to cause a relatively sudden change in vision resulting in serious vision loss.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dry-macular-degeneration/symptoms-causes/syc-20350375
Wet macular degeneration,"Wet macular degeneration is an eye condition that causes blurred vision or reduced central vision. It is a type of age-related macular degeneration where blood vessels leak fluid or blood into part of the retina known as the macula (MAK-u-luh). The macula is responsible for central vision.
Wet macular degeneration is one of two types of age-related macular degeneration. The other type, dry macular degeneration, is more common and less severe. The wet type always begins as the dry type.
Early detection and treatment of wet macular degeneration may help reduce vision loss. In some instances, early treatment may recover vision.","Wet macular degeneration symptoms usually appear suddenly and worsen quickly. They may include: | Visual distortions, such as straight lines that seem to be bent. | Reduced central vision in one or both eyes. | The need for brighter light when reading or doing close-up work. | Difficulty adjusting to low light levels, such as when entering a dimly lit restaurant or theater. | Increased blurriness of printed words. | Difficulty recognizing faces. | A well-defined blurry spot or blind spot in the field of vision. | Macular degeneration doesn't affect side vision, so it doesn't cause total blindness.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/wet-macular-degeneration/symptoms-causes/syc-20351107
Myelofibrosis,"Myelofibrosis is an uncommon type of bone marrow cancer that disrupts your body's normal production of blood cells.
Myelofibrosis causes extensive scarring in your bone marrow, leading to severe anemia that can cause weakness and fatigue. Bone marrow scarring can also cause you to have a low number of blood-clotting cells called platelets, which increases the risk of bleeding. Myelofibrosis often causes an enlarged spleen.
Myelofibrosis is considered to be a chronic leukemia — a cancer that affects the blood-forming tissues in the body. Myelofibrosis belongs to a group of diseases called myeloproliferative disorders.
Myelofibrosis can happen on its own (primary myelofibrosis) or it can develop from another bone marrow disorder (secondary myelofibrosis).
Some people with myelofibrosis have no symptoms and might not need treatment right away. Others with more-serious forms of the disease might need aggressive treatments right away. Treatment for myelofibrosis, which focuses on relieving symptoms, can involve a variety of options.","Myelofibrosis usually develops slowly. In its very early stages, many people don't experience signs or symptoms. | As disruption of normal blood cell production increases, signs and symptoms may include: | Feeling tired, weak or short of breath, usually because of anemia | Pain or fullness below your ribs on the left side, due to an enlarged spleen | Easy bruising | Easy bleeding | Excessive sweating during sleep (night sweats) | Fever | Bone pain",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myelofibrosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355057
Agoraphobia,"Agoraphobia (ag-uh-ruh-FOE-be-uh) is a type of anxiety disorder. Agoraphobia involves fearing and avoiding places or situations that might cause panic and feelings of being trapped, helpless or embarrassed. You may fear an actual or upcoming situation. For example, you may fear using public transportation, being in open or enclosed spaces, standing in line, or being in a crowd.
The anxiety is caused by fear that there's no easy way to escape or get help if the anxiety gets overwhelming. You may avoid situations because of fears such as getting lost, falling, or having diarrhea and not being able to get to a bathroom. Most people who have agoraphobia develop it after having one or more panic attacks, causing them to worry about having another attack. They then avoid the places where it may happen again.
Agoraphobia often results in having a hard time feeling safe in any public place, especially where crowds gather and in locations that are not familiar. You may feel that you need a companion, such as a family member or friend, to go with you to public places. The fear can be so overwhelming that you may feel you can't leave your home.
Agoraphobia treatment can be challenging because it means confronting your fears. But with proper treatment — usually a form of therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy and medicines — you can escape the trap of agoraphobia and live a more enjoyable life.","Typical agoraphobia symptoms include fear of: | Leaving home alone. | Crowds or waiting in line. | Enclosed spaces, such as movie theaters, elevators or small stores. | Open spaces, such as parking lots, bridges or malls. | Using public transportation, such as a bus, plane or train. | These situations cause anxiety because you fear you won't be able to escape or find help if you start to feel panicked. Or you may fear having other disabling or embarrassing symptoms, such as dizziness, fainting, falling or diarrhea. | In addition: | Your fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger of the situation. | You avoid the situation, you need a companion to go with you, or you endure the situation but are extremely upset. | You have major distress or problems with social situations, work or other areas in your life because of the fear, anxiety or avoidance. | Your fear and avoidance usually lasts six months or longer.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/agoraphobia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355987

Albinism,"The term albinism usually refers to oculocutaneous (ok-u-low-ku-TAY-nee-us) albinism (OCA).OCAis a group of disorders passed down in families where the body makes little or none of a substance called melanin. The type and amount of melanin in your body determines the color of your skin, hair and eyes. Melanin also plays a role in the development and function of the eyes, so people with albinism have vision problems.
Symptoms of albinism are usually seen in a person's skin, hair and eye color, but sometimes differences are slight. People with albinism are also sensitive to the effects of the sun, so they're at higher risk of getting skin cancer.
Although there's no cure for albinism, people with the disorder can take steps to protect their skin and eyes and get proper eye and skin care.","Symptoms of albinism involve skin, hair and eye color, as well as vision.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/albinism/symptoms-causes/syc-20369184

Alcoholic hepatitis,"Alcoholic hepatitis is swelling, called inflammation, of the liver caused by drinking alcohol. Drinking alcohol destroys liver cells.
Alcoholic hepatitis most often happens in people who drink heavily over many years. But the link between drinking and alcoholic hepatitis isn't simple. Not all heavy drinkers get alcoholic hepatitis. And some people who drink much less get the disease.
If you're diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis, you must stop drinking alcohol. People who keep drinking alcohol have a high risk of serious liver damage and death.","The most common sign of alcoholic hepatitis is yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, called jaundice. The yellowing of the skin might be harder to see on Black and brown people. | Other symptoms include: | Loss of appetite. | Nausea and vomiting. | Belly tenderness. | Fever, often low grade. | Tiredness and weakness. | People with alcoholic hepatitis tend to be malnourished. Drinking large amounts of alcohol keeps people from being hungry.

But unlike a cold, hay fever isn't caused by a virus. Hay fever is caused by an allergic response to a harmless outdoor or indoor substance the body identifies as harmful (allergen).
Common allergens that can trigger hay fever symptoms include pollen and dust mites. Tiny flecks of skin shed by cats, dogs, and other animals with fur or feathers (pet dander) also can be allergens.
Besides making you miserable, hay fever can affect how well you perform at work or school and can generally interfere with your life. But you don't have to put up with annoying symptoms. You can learn to avoid triggers and find the right treatment.","Hay fever symptoms can include: | Runny nose and nasal stuffiness, called congestion. | Watery, itchy, red eyes. | Sneezing. | Cough. | Itchy nose, roof of mouth or throat. | Mucus that runs down the back of the throat, called postnasal drip. | Swollen, bruised-appearing skin under the eyes, known as allergic shiners. | Extreme tiredness and fatigue, often due to poor sleep.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hay-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20373039
Allergies,"Allergies happen when the immune system reacts to a foreign substance that gets inside the body. These substances are known as allergens. They include pollen, bee venom and pet dander. Allergies also can happen due to certain foods and medicines that don't cause reactions in most people.
The immune system makes protective proteins called antibodies that attack invaders such as germs. But with allergies, the immune system makes antibodies that mark a specific allergen as harmful, even though it isn't. Coming into contact with the allergen causes an immune system reaction that can inflame the skin, sinuses, airways or digestive system.
Allergic reactions vary from person to person. They can range from minor irritation to a life-threatening emergency called anaphylaxis. While most allergies can't be cured, treatments can help relieve your allergy symptoms.","Allergy symptoms depend on what allergen is involved. The symptoms can affect the airways, sinuses and nasal passages, skin, and digestive system. Allergic reactions can range from mild to severe. Sometimes, allergies can trigger a life-threatening reaction known as anaphylaxis. | Hay fever,also called allergic rhinitis, can cause: | Sneezing. | Itching of the skin, nose, eyes or roof of the mouth. | Runny, stuffy nose. | Tiredness, also called fatigue. | Watery, red or swollen eyes, also called allergic conjunctivitis. | A food allergycan cause: | Tingling in the mouth. | Swelling of the lips, tongue, face or throat. | Itchy welts called hives. | Stuffy nose, sneezing or teary eyes that itch. | Stomach cramps, vomiting or diarrhea. | Anaphylaxis. | An insect sting allergycan cause: | Pain and a large area of swelling called edema at the sting site. | Itching or hives all over the body. | Skin warmth and a change in skin color, also called flushing. | Cough, chest tightness, wheezing or shortness of breath. | Anaphylaxis. | A medicine allergycan cause: | Hives. | Itchy skin or rash. | Facial swelling. | Wheezing. | Shortness of breath. | Vomiting or diarrhea. | Feeling dizzy. | Anaphylaxis. | Atopic dermatitis,an allergic skin condition also called eczema, can cause skin to: | Itch. | Form red or brown patches that may be harder to see on darker skin tones. | Flake, peel or crack.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/allergies/symptoms-causes/syc-20351497

Food allergy,"Food allergy is an immune system reaction that happens soon after eating a certain food. Even a tiny amount of the allergy-causing food can trigger symptoms such as hives, swollen airways and digestive problems. In some people, a food allergy can cause severe symptoms or even a life-threatening reaction known as anaphylaxis.
Food allergy affects an estimated 8% of children under age 5 and up to 4% of adults. While there's no cure, some children outgrow their food allergies as they get older.
It's easy to confuse a food allergy with a much more common reaction known as food intolerance. While bothersome, food intolerance is a less serious condition that does not involve the immune system.","For some people, an allergic reaction to a particular food may be uncomfortable but not severe. For other people, a food allergy reaction can be frightening and even life-threatening. Food allergy symptoms usually develop within a few minutes to two hours after eating the offending food. Rarely, symptoms may be delayed for several hours. | The most common food allergy symptoms include: | Tingling or itching in the mouth. | Hives, itching or eczema. | Swelling of the lips, face, tongue, and throat or other parts of the body. | Belly pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting. | Wheezing, nasal congestion or trouble breathing. | Dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/food-allergy/symptoms-causes/syc-20355095
Latex allergy,"Latex allergy is a reaction to certain proteins found in natural rubber latex, a product made from the rubber tree. If you have a latex allergy, your body mistakes latex for a harmful substance.
Latex allergy may cause itchy skin and hives or even anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a possibly life-threatening condition that can cause throat swelling and serious difficulty breathing. A healthcare professional can find out if you have a latex allergy or if you're at risk of developing a latex allergy.
Understanding latex allergy and knowing common sources of latex can help you prevent allergic reactions.","If you're allergic to latex, you're likely to have symptoms after touching latex rubber products, such as gloves or balloons. You also can have symptoms if you breathe in latex particles that are released into the air when someone removes latex gloves. | Latex allergy symptoms range from mild to serious. A reaction depends on how sensitive you are to latex and the amount of latex you touch or inhale. Your reaction can become worse with each additional latex exposure.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/latex-allergy/symptoms-causes/syc-20374287

Peanut allergy,"Peanut allergy is a condition that causes the body's germ-fighting immune system to react to peanuts. It's one of the most common causes of a life-threatening allergic reaction to food. This life-threatening reaction is known as anaphylaxis.
Peanut allergy has been increasing in children. Even if you or your child has shown only a mild reaction to peanuts, it's important to talk to a healthcare professional. There is still a risk of a more serious future reaction.","An allergic response to peanuts usually occurs within minutes after exposure. Peanut allergy signs and symptoms can include: | Skin reactions, such as hives, redness or swelling. | Itching or tingling in or around the mouth and throat. | Digestive problems, such as diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea or vomiting. | Tightening of the throat. | Shortness of breath or wheezing. | Runny nose.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peanut-allergy/symptoms-causes/syc-20376175

Shellfish allergy,"Shellfish allergy is an atypical response by the body's immune system to proteins in certain marine animals. Marine animals in the shellfish category include crustaceans and mollusks. Examples are shrimp, crabs, lobster, squid, oysters, scallops and snails.
Shellfish is a common food allergy. Some people with shellfish allergy react to all shellfish, while others react to only certain kinds. Reactions range from mild symptoms — such as hives or a stuffy nose — to severe and even life-threatening.
If you think you have shellfish allergy, talk to your health care provider. Tests can help confirm the allergy so you can take steps to avoid future reactions.","Shellfish allergy symptoms generally start within minutes to an hour after eating or having contact with shellfish. They may include: | Hives | Itchy, irritated skin | Nasal stuffiness (congestion) | Swelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat, or other parts of the body | Wheezing or trouble breathing | Coughing and choking or a tight feeling in the throat | Belly (abdominal) pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting | Dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/shellfish-allergy/symptoms-causes/syc-20377503

Hair loss,"Hair loss (alopecia) can affect just your scalp or your entire body, and it can be temporary or permanent. It can be the result of heredity, hormonal changes, medical conditions or a normal part of aging. Anyone can lose hair on their head, but it's more common in men.
Baldness typically refers to excessive hair loss from your scalp. Hereditary hair loss with age is the most common cause of baldness. Some people prefer to let their hair loss run its course untreated and unhidden. Others may cover it up with hairstyles, makeup, hats or scarves. And still others choose one of the treatments available to prevent further hair loss or restore growth.
Before pursuing hair loss treatment, talk with your doctor about the cause of your hair loss and treatment options.","Hair loss can appear in many different ways, depending on what's causing it. It can come on suddenly or gradually and affect just your scalp or your whole body. | Signs and symptoms of hair loss may include: | Gradual thinning on top of head.This is the most common type of hair loss, affecting people as they age. In men, hair often begins to recede at the hairline on the forehead. Women typically have a broadening of the part in their hair. An increasingly common hair loss pattern in older women is a receding hairline (frontal fibrosing alopecia). | Circular or patchy bald spots.Some people lose hair in circular or patchy bald spots on the scalp, beard or eyebrows. Your skin may become itchy or painful before the hair falls out. | Sudden loosening of hair.A physical or emotional shock can cause hair to loosen. Handfuls of hair may come out when combing or washing your hair or even after gentle tugging. This type of hair loss usually causes overall hair thinning but is temporary. | Full-body hair loss.Some conditions and medical treatments, such as chemotherapy for cancer, can result in the loss of hair all over your body. The hair usually grows back. | Patches of scaling that spread over the scalp.This is a sign of ringworm. It may be accompanied by broken hair, redness, swelling and, at times, oozing.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hair-loss/symptoms-causes/syc-20372926
Alpha-gal syndrome,"Alpha-gal syndrome is a type of food allergy. It makes people allergic to red meat and other products made from mammals.
In the United States, the condition usually begins with the bite of the Lone Star tick. The bite transfers a sugar molecule called alpha-gal into the body. In some people, this triggers a reaction from the body's defenses, also called the immune system. It causes mild to severe allergic reactions to red meat, such as beef, pork or lamb. It also can cause reactions to other foods that come from mammals, such as dairy products or gelatins.
The Lone Star tick is found mainly in the southeastern United States. Most cases of alpha-gal syndrome are reported in the south, east and central United States. But the condition appears to be spreading farther north and west. Deer are carrying the Lone Star tick to new parts of the country. Other types of ticks carry alpha-gal molecules in different parts of the world. Alpha-gal syndrome has been diagnosed in parts of Europe, Australia, Asia, South Africa, and South and Central America.
Some people may have alpha-gal syndrome and not know it. There are people who often have serious allergic reactions, also called anaphylactic reactions, for no clear reason. Tests also show that they don't have other food allergies. Researchers think that some of these people may be affected by alpha-gal syndrome.
There's no treatment other than avoiding red meat and other products made from mammals. If you have a serious allergic reaction, you may need medicine called epinephrine and treatment at the emergency room.
Avoid tick bites to prevent alpha-gal syndrome. Wear long pants and long-sleeved shirts when you're in wooded, grassy areas. Use bug spray too. Check your whole body for ticks after you spend time outside.","The symptoms of an alpha-gal allergic reaction usually take longer to start compared with those of other food allergies. Most reactions to common food allergens — peanuts or shellfish, for example — happen within minutes after you are exposed to them. In alpha-gal syndrome, reactions usually appear about 3 to 6 hours after you are exposed. Foods that can cause a reaction include: | Red meat, such as beef, pork or lamb. | Organ meats. | Products made from mammals, such as gelatins or dairy products. | Symptoms of alpha-gal syndrome may include: | Hives, itching, or itchy, scaly skin. | Swelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat, or other body parts. | Wheezing or shortness of breath. | Stomach pain, diarrhea, upset stomach or vomiting. | The time delay between eating meat products and getting an allergic reaction may be one reason alpha-gal syndrome was not understood at first. For example, a possible connection between a T-bone steak with dinner and hives at midnight is far from clear. | Researchers think they know the reason for the delayed reaction. They say it's due to the alpha-gal molecules taking longer than other allergens to be digested and enter the system that moves blood through the body.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alpha-gal-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20428608
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (a-my-o-TROE-fik LAT-ur-ul skluh-ROE-sis), known as ALS, is a nervous system disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.ALScauses loss of muscle control. The disease gets worse over time.
ALSis often called Lou Gehrig's disease after the baseball player who was diagnosed with it. The exact cause of the disease is still not known. A small number of cases are inherited.
ALSoften begins with muscle twitching and weakness in an arm or leg, trouble swallowing or slurred speech. EventuallyALSaffects control of the muscles needed to move, speak, eat and breathe. There is no cure for this fatal disease.","Symptoms ofALSvary from person to person. Symptoms depend on which nerve cells are affected.ALSgenerally begins with muscle weakness that spreads and gets worse over time. Symptoms might include: | Trouble walking or doing usual daily activities. | Tripping and falling. | Weakness in the legs, feet or ankles. | Hand weakness or clumsiness. | Slurred speech or trouble swallowing. | Weakness associated with muscle cramps and twitching in the arms, shoulders and tongue. | Untimely crying, laughing or yawning. | Thinking or behavioral changes. | ALSoften starts in the hands, feet, arms or legs. Then it spreads to other parts of the body. Muscles get weaker as more nerve cells die. This eventually affects chewing, swallowing, speaking and breathing. | There's generally no pain in the early stages ofALS. Pain also is not common in the later stages.ALSdoesn't usually affect bladder control.

Dry socket,"Dry socket is a painful dental condition that sometimes happens after you have a tooth removed. Having a tooth removed is called an extraction. Dry socket happens when a blood clot at the site where the tooth was removed does not form, comes out or dissolves before the wound has healed.
Usually a blood clot forms at the site where a tooth was removed. This blood clot is a protective layer over the underlying bone and nerve endings in the empty tooth socket. Also, the clot contains cells that are needed for proper healing of the site.
Intense pain happens when the underlying bone and nerves are exposed. Pain occurs in the socket and along the nerves to the side of the face. The socket becomes swollen and irritated. It may fill with bits of food, making the pain worse. If you get a dry socket, the pain usually begins 1 to 3 days after the tooth removal.
Dry socket is the most common complication following tooth removals, such as the removal of third molars, also called wisdom teeth. Medicine you can buy without a prescription usually will not be enough to treat dry socket pain. Your dentist or oral surgeon can offer treatments to relieve your pain.","Symptoms of dry socket may include: | Severe pain within a few days after removing a tooth. | Loss of part or all of the blood clot at the tooth removal site. The socket may look empty. | Bone that you can see in the socket. | Pain that spreads from the socket to your ear, eye, temple or neck on the same side of your face as the tooth removal. | Bad breath or a foul odor coming from your mouth. | Bad taste in your mouth.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dry-socket/symptoms-causes/syc-20354376
Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. Alzheimer's disease is the biological process that begins with the appearance of a buildup of proteins in the form of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. This causes brain cells to die over time and the brain to shrink.
About 6.9 million people in the United States age 65 and older live with Alzheimer's disease. Among them, more than 70% are age 75 and older. Of the more than 55 million people in the world with dementia, 60% to 70% are estimated to have Alzheimer's disease.
Early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease include forgetting recent events or conversations. Over time, Alzheimer's disease leads to serious memory loss and affects a person's ability to do everyday tasks.
There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease. In advanced stages, loss of brain function can cause dehydration, poor nutrition or infection. These complications can result in death.
But medicines may improve symptoms or slow the decline in thinking. Programs and services can help support people with the disease and their caregivers.","Memory loss is the key symptom of Alzheimer's disease. Early in the disease, people may have trouble remembering recent events or conversations. Over time, memory gets worse and other symptoms occur. | At first, someone with the disease may be aware of having trouble remembering things and thinking clearly. As signs and symptoms get worse, a family member or friend may be more likely to notice the issues. | Brain changes from Alzheimer's disease lead to the following symptoms that get worse over time.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350447
Atypical genitalia,"Atypical genitalia, formerly called ambiguous genitalia, is a rare condition in which an infant's genitals don't appear to be clearly male or female on the outside. In a baby with atypical genitalia, the genitals may not be developed fully or may look different from what is expected. Or the baby may have features of more than one sex. The sex organs on the outside of the body may not match the sex organs on the inside. And they may not match the genetic sex, which is determined by sex chromosomes: typically, XX for females and XY for males.
External genitals are the sex organs on the outside of the body. They include the opening of the vagina and the labia, clitoris, penis and scrotum. Internal genitals are the sex organs inside the body. They include the vagina, fallopian tubes, uterus, prostate, ovaries and testicles. Sex hormones are made by the ovaries and testicles, which also are called gonads. Genetic sex is set based on sex chromosomes. Typically, these sex chromosomes are a genetic female with two X chromosomes and a genetic male with one X and one Y chromosome.
Atypical genitalia is not a disease; it's a difference of sex development. Usually, atypical genitalia can be seen at or shortly after birth. The condition can be very distressing for families. Your medical team looks for the cause of atypical genitalia and provides information and counseling that can help guide decisions about your baby's sex and any needed treatment.","Your medical team will likely be the first to notice atypical genitalia soon after your baby is born. Sometimes, atypical genitalia may be suspected before birth. Atypical genitalia can vary in appearance. Differences may depend on when during genital development the hormone changes that affected development occurred and the cause. | Babies who are genetically female, which means they have two X chromosomes, may have: | An enlarged clitoris, which may look like a penis. | Closed labia, or labia that include folds and look like a scrotum. | Lumps that feel like testicles in the fused labia. | Babies who are genetically male, which means they have one X and one Y chromosome, may have: | A condition in which the narrow tube that carries urine and semen, called the urethra, doesn't fully extend to the tip of the penis. If the tube opening is on the underside of the penis, the condition is called hypospadias. | A very small penis with the urethral opening closer to the scrotum. | One or both testicles missing in what appears to be the scrotum. | Testicles that remain in the body, also called undescended testicles, and an empty scrotum that has the appearance of labia with or without a micropenis.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atypical-genitalia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369273

Amenorrhea,"Amenorrhea (uh-men-o-REE-uh) is the absence of menstruation, often defined as missing one or more menstrual periods.
Primary amenorrhea refers to the absence of menstruation in someone who has not had a period by age 15. The most common causes of primary amenorrhea relate to hormone levels, although anatomical problems also can cause amenorrhea.
Secondary amenorrhea refers to the absence of three or more periods in a row by someone who has had periods in the past. Pregnancy is the most common cause of secondary amenorrhea, although problems with hormones also can cause secondary amenorrhea.
Treatment of amenorrhea depends on the underlying cause.","Depending on the cause of amenorrhea, you might experience other signs or symptoms along with the absence of periods, such as: | Milky nipple discharge | Hair loss | Headache | Vision changes | Excess facial hair | Pelvic pain | Acne",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amenorrhea/symptoms-causes/syc-20369299

Amnesia,"Amnesia refers to the loss of memories, including facts, information and experiences. Movies and television tend to depict amnesia as forgetting your identity, but that's not generally the case in real life.
Instead, people with amnesia — also called amnestic syndrome — usually know who they are. But they may have trouble learning new information and forming new memories.
Amnesia can be caused by damage to areas of the brain that are vital for memory processing. Unlike a temporary episode of memory loss, called transient global amnesia, amnesia can be permanent.
There's no specific treatment for amnesia, but treatment can be directed at the underlying cause. Tips to help enhance memory and get support can help people with amnesia and their families cope.","The two main features of amnesia are: | Trouble learning new information. | Trouble remembering past events and previously familiar information. | Most people with amnesia have problems with short-term memory, so they can't retain new information. Recent memories are most likely to be lost. More-remote or deeply ingrained memories may be spared. | For example, people may recall experiences from childhood or know the names of past presidents. But they may not be able to name the current president, know the month or remember what they ate for breakfast. | Isolated memory loss doesn't affect a person's intelligence, general knowledge, awareness or attention span. It also doesn't affect judgment, personality or identity. People with amnesia usually can understand written and spoken words and can learn skills such as bike riding or piano playing. They may understand they have a memory disorder. | Amnesia isn't the same as dementia. Dementia often includes memory loss but also involves other problems with thinking that lead to a decline in daily functioning. These problems include having trouble with language, judgment and visual-spatial skills. | Memory loss also is a common symptom of mild cognitive impairment. This disorder involves memory and other cognitive problems that aren't as severe as those experienced in dementia.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amnesia/symptoms-causes/syc-20353360

Ampullary cancer,"Ampullary cancer is cancer that starts as a growth of cells in the ampulla of Vater. The ampulla of Vater is located where the bile duct and pancreatic duct join and empty into the small intestine. Ampullary (AM-poo-la-ree) cancer is rare.
Ampullary cancer forms near many other parts of the digestive system. This includes the liver, pancreas and small intestine. When ampullary cancer grows, it may affect these other organs.
Ampullary cancer treatment often involves surgery to remove the cancer. Treatment also may include radiation therapy and chemotherapy to kill cancer cells.","Signs and symptoms of ampullary cancer may include: | Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, called jaundice. | Diarrhea. | Clay-colored stools. | Abdominal pain. | Fever. | Blood in the stool. | Nausea. | Vomiting. | Weight loss.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ampullary-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355066
Amyloidosis,"Amyloidosis (am-uh-loi-DO-sis) is a rare disease that occurs when a protein called amyloid builds up in organs. This amyloid buildup can make the organs not work properly.
Organs that may be affected include the heart, kidneys, liver, spleen, nervous system and digestive tract.
Some types of amyloidosis occur with other diseases. These types may improve with treatment of the other diseases. Some types of amyloidosis may lead to life-threatening organ failure.
Treatments may include chemotherapy with strong drugs used to treat cancer. Other types of medications can reduce amyloid production and control symptoms. Some people may benefit from organ or stem cell transplants.","You may not experience symptoms of amyloidosis until later in the course of the disease. Symptoms may vary, depending on which organs are affected. | Signs and symptoms of amyloidosis may include: | Severe fatigue and weakness | Shortness of breath | Numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet | Swelling of the ankles and legs | Diarrhea, possibly with blood, or constipation | An enlarged tongue, which sometimes looks rippled around its edge | Skin changes, such as thickening or easy bruising, and purplish patches around the eyes",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amyloidosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353178
Anal cancer,"Anal cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the anal canal. The anal canal is a short tube at the end of rectum. Stool passes through the anal canal as it leaves the body.
Anal cancer can cause symptoms such as rectal bleeding, blood in the stool and anal pain. As it grows, it might cause a growth or lump. Sometimes these symptoms might be mistaken for hemorrhoids.
In the past, most people with anal cancer had surgery to remove the cancer. Often this operation involved making a new way for waste to leave the body. Today, most anal cancer treatment involves chemotherapy and radiation therapy. With this approach, surgery might not be needed.",Anal cancer signs and symptoms include: | Bleeding from the anus or rectum. | Blood in the stool. | Pain in the area of the anus. | A mass or growth in the anal canal. | Anal itching. | Having to go to the bathroom more often.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20354140
Anal fissure,"An anal fissure is a small tear in the thin, moist tissue that lines the anus. The anus is the opening at the end of the digestive tract where stool exits the body. Common causes of an anal fissure include constipation and straining or passing hard or large stools during a bowel movement. Anal fissures typically cause pain and bleeding with bowel movements. You also may experience spasms in the ring of muscle at the end of your anus, called the anal sphincter.
Anal fissures are very common in young infants but can affect people of any age. Most anal fissures get better with simple treatments, such as eating more fiber or soaking in a warm-water bath. Some people with anal fissures may need medicine. Sometimes, surgery may be necessary.",Symptoms of an anal fissure include: | Pain during bowel movements. | Pain after bowel movements that can last up to several hours. | Bright red blood on the stool or toilet paper after a bowel movement. | A visible crack in the skin around the anus. | A small lump or skin tag near the anal fissure.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anal-fissure/symptoms-causes/syc-20351424
Anal fistula,"An anal fistula — also called fistula-in-ano — is a tunnel that develops between the inside of the anus and the outside skin around the anus. The anus is the muscular opening at the end of the digestive tract where stool exits the body.
Most anal fistulas are the result of an infection that starts in an anal gland. The infection causes an abscess that drains on its own or is drained surgically through the skin next to the anus. This drainage tunnel remains open and connects the infected anal gland or the anal canal to a hole in the outside skin around the anus.
Surgery is usually needed to treat an anal fistula. Sometimes nonsurgical treatments may be an option.","Symptoms of an anal fistula can include: | An opening on the skin around the anus | A red, inflamed area around the tunnel opening | Oozing of pus, blood or stool from the tunnel opening | Pain in the rectum and anus, especially when sitting or passing stool | Fever",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anal-fistula/symptoms-causes/syc-20352871
Anal itching,"Anal itching is a common condition. The itch in or around the anus is often intense and can be embarrassing and uncomfortable.
Anal itching, also called pruritus ani (proo-RIE-tus A-nie), has several possible causes. They include infections, hemorrhoids and ongoing diarrhea.  Skin inflammation, also called dermatitis, is another cause.
If the symptoms don't clear up with self-care, talk with your health care provider.

Hemoglobin is a protein found in red cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to all other organs in the body. Having anemia can cause tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath.
There are many forms of anemia. Each has its own cause. Anemia can be short term or long term. It can range from mild to severe. Anemia can be a warning sign of serious illness.
Treatments for anemia might involve taking supplements or having medical procedures. Eating a healthy diet might prevent some forms of anemia.","Anemia symptoms depend on the cause and how bad the anemia is. Anemia can be so mild that it causes no symptoms at first.

Brain aneurysm,"A brain aneurysm (AN-yoo-riz-um) — also known as a cerebral aneurysm or intracranial aneurysm — is a bulge or ballooning in a blood vessel in the brain. An aneurysm often looks like a berry hanging on a stem.
Experts think brain aneurysms form and grow because blood flowing through the blood vessel puts pressure on a weak area of the vessel wall. This can increase the size of the brain aneurysm. If the brain aneurysm leaks or ruptures, it causes bleeding in the brain, known as a hemorrhagic stroke.
Most often, a ruptured brain aneurysm occurs in the space between the brain and the thin tissues covering the brain. This type of hemorrhagic stroke is called a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Brain aneurysms are common. But most brain aneurysms aren't serious, especially if they're small. Most brain aneurysms don't rupture. They usually don't cause symptoms or cause health problems. In many cases, brain aneurysms are found during tests for other conditions.
However, a ruptured aneurysm quickly becomes life-threatening and requires medical treatment right away.
If a brain aneurysm hasn't ruptured, treatment may be appropriate in some cases. Treatment of an unruptured brain aneurysm may prevent a rupture in the future. Talk with your health care provider to make sure you understand the best options for your specific needs.","Most brain aneurysms that haven't ruptured don't cause symptoms. This is especially true if they're small. Brain aneurysms may be found during imaging tests that are done for other conditions. | However, a ruptured aneurysm is a very serious condition, typically causing a severe headache. And if an unruptured aneurysm presses against brain tissue or nerves, it may cause pain and other symptoms.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brain-aneurysm/symptoms-causes/syc-20361483
Thoracic aortic aneurysm,"A thoracic aortic aneurysm is a weakened area in the body's main artery in the chest. The body's main artery is called the aorta. When the aortic wall is weak, the artery may widen. When the vessel is significantly widened, it's called an aneurysm.
A thoracic aortic aneurysm also is called a thoracic aneurysm.
Treatment of a thoracic aortic aneurysm may vary from regular health checkups to emergency surgery. The type of treatment depends on the cause, size and growth rate of the thoracic aortic aneurysm.
Complications of a thoracic aortic aneurysm include rupture of the aorta or a life-threatening tear between the layers of the aorta's wall. The tear is called an aortic dissection. Rupture or dissection can lead to sudden death.
Thoracic aortic aneurysms are less common than aneurysms that form in the lower part of the aorta, called abdominal aortic aneurysms.","Thoracic aortic aneurysms often grow slowly. There are usually no symptoms, making them difficult to detect. Many start small and stay small. Others grow bigger over time. How quickly a thoracic aortic aneurysm may grow is difficult to predict. | As a thoracic aortic aneurysm grows, symptoms may include: | Back pain. | Cough. | Weak, scratchy voice. | Shortness of breath. | Tenderness or pain in the chest. | Symptoms that a thoracic aortic aneurysm has ruptured or dissected include: | Sharp, sudden pain in the upper back that spreads downward. | Pain in the chest, jaw, neck or arms. | Difficulty breathing. | Low blood pressure. | Loss of consciousness. | Shortness of breath. | Trouble swallowing. | Some aneurysms may never rupture or lead to dissection.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thoracic-aortic-aneurysm/symptoms-causes/syc-20350188
Aneurysms,"An aneurysm is an abnormal bulge or ballooning in the wall of a blood vessel. An aneurysm can burst. This is called a rupture. A ruptured aneurysm causes bleeding inside the body and often leads to death. Some aneurysms may not cause symptoms. You might not know you have an aneurysm even if it is large.
Aneurysms can develop in several parts of the body, including:
Some small aneurysms have a low risk of rupture. To determine the risk of an aneurysm rupture, a health care provider considers:
Treatment of some aneurysms may only involve regular health checkups and imaging tests. If an aneurysm breaks open, emergency open surgery is needed. Sometimes a less-invasive treatment called endovascular surgery may be done.",,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aneurysms/symptoms-causes/syc-20354633
Angelman syndrome,"Angelman syndrome is a condition caused by a change in a gene, called a genetic change. Angelman syndrome causes delayed development, problems with speech and balance, mental disability, and, sometimes, seizures.
Many people with Angelman syndrome smile and laugh often. They tend to be happy and easy to excite.
Delays in maturing, called developmental delays, begin between about 6 and 12 months of age. The delays often are the first signs of Angelman syndrome. Seizures may begin between the ages of 2 and 3 years old.
People with Angelman syndrome tend to live close to a typical life span. But the condition can't be cured. Treatment focuses on managing medical, sleep and developmental issues.","Angelman syndrome symptoms include: | Developmental delays, including no crawling or babbling at 6 to 12 months. | Mental disability, also called intellectual disability. | No speech or little speech. | Trouble walking, moving or balancing. | Smiling and laughing often and seeming happy. | Being easy to excite. | Trouble sucking or feeding. | Trouble going to sleep and staying asleep. | People who have Angelman syndrome also may have: | Seizures, often beginning between 2 and 3 years of age. | Stiff or jerky movements. | Small head size by age 2. | Tongue thrusting. | Hair, skin and eyes that are light in color. | Odd behaviors, such as hand flapping and arms uplifted while walking. | Crossed eyes, also caused strabismus. | Curved spine, also called scoliosis.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/angelman-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20355621
Angina,"Angina (an-JIE-nuh or AN-juh-nuh) is a type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. Angina is a symptom of coronary artery disease.
Angina also is called angina pectoris.
Angina is often described as squeezing, pressure, heaviness, tightness or pain in the chest. It may feel like a heavy weight lying on the chest. Angina may be a new pain that needs to be checked by a healthcare professional, or it may be recurring pain that goes away with treatment.
Angina is relatively common. But some people may not be able to tell it apart from other types of chest pain, such as heartburn. If you have unexplained chest pain, get medical help right away.","Angina symptoms include chest pain and discomfort. The chest pain or discomfort may feel like: | Burning. | Fullness. | Pressure. | Squeezing. | Pain also may be felt in the arms, neck, jaw, shoulder or back. | Other symptoms of angina include: | Dizziness. | Fatigue. | Nausea. | Shortness of breath. | Sweating. | The severity, duration and type of angina can vary.

Hives and angioedema,"Hives — also known as urticaria (ur-tih-KAR-e-uh) — is a skin reaction that causes itchy welts that range in size from small spots to large blotches. Hives can be triggered by many situations and substances, including certain foods and medications.
Angioedema can arise with hives or alone. It causes swelling in the deeper layers of skin, often around the face and lips. Short-lived (acute) hives and angioedema are common. Most times, they are harmless, clear up within in a day and don't leave any lasting marks, even without treatment. Hives that last longer than six weeks are called chronic hives.
Hives and angioedema are usually treated with antihistamine medication. Angioedema can be life-threatening if swelling of the tongue or in the throat blocks the airway.",,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hives-and-angioedema/symptoms-causes/syc-20354908
Castleman disease,"Castleman disease is a group of rare disorders that involves lymph nodes that get bigger, called enlarged lymph nodes, and a wide range of symptoms. The most common form of the disorder involves a single enlarged lymph node. This lymph node is usually in the chest or neck, but it can occur in other areas of the body as well. This form of the disorder is called unicentric Castleman disease (UCD).
Multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) involves multiple regions of enlarged lymph nodes, inflammatory symptoms and problems with organ function. There are three types of MCD:
Sometimes, people may have 2-3 enlarged lymph nodes and mild symptoms that do not meet the diagnostic criteria for MCD. These people may have another disease, or they may have the recently described subtype of Castleman disease called oligocentric Castleman disease. This subtype is rare.
Treatment and outlook vary depending on the type of Castleman disease you have. Unicentric Castleman disease, which is the type that involves only one enlarged lymph node, can usually be successfully treated with surgery.
The best treatment for oligocentric Castleman disease, which involves a few enlarged lymph nodes and has limited symptoms, is not known but is thought to be similar to the treatment for unicentric Castleman disease.
While not all people with MCD respond to the first treatment, there are medicines that work to treat HHV-8-associated MCD and idiopathic MCD.",Many people with unicentric Castleman disease don't notice any signs or symptoms. The enlarged lymph node may be found during a physical exam or an imaging test for a different problem. | Some people with unicentric Castleman disease might have signs and symptoms that are more often seen in multicentric Castleman disease.

Broken ankle,,,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-ankle/symptoms-causes/syc-20450025
Sprained ankle,"A sprained ankle is an injury that occurs when you roll, twist or turn your ankle in an awkward way. This can stretch or tear the tough bands of tissue (ligaments) that help hold your ankle bones together.
Ligaments help stabilize joints, preventing excessive movement. A sprained ankle occurs when the ligaments are forced beyond their normal range of motion. Most sprained ankles involve injuries to the ligaments on the outer side of the ankle.
Treatment for a sprained ankle depends on the severity of the injury. Although self-care measures and over-the-counter pain medications may be all you need, a medical evaluation might be necessary to reveal how badly you've sprained your ankle and to determine the appropriate treatment.","Signs and symptoms of a sprained ankle vary depending on the severity of the injury. They may include: | Pain, especially when you bear weight on the affected foot | Tenderness when you touch the ankle | Swelling | Bruising | Restricted range of motion | Instability in the ankle | Popping sensation or sound at the time of injury",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sprained-ankle/symptoms-causes/syc-20353225
Tongue-tie (ankyloglossia),"Tongue-tie (ankyloglossia) is a condition present at birth that restricts the tongue's range of motion.
With tongue-tie, an unusually short, thick or tight band of tissue (lingual frenulum) tethers the bottom of the tongue's tip to the floor of the mouth. Depending on how much the tissue restricts tongue movement, it may interfere with breastfeeding. Someone who has tongue-tie might have difficulty sticking out the tongue. Tongue-tie can also affect eating or speaking.
Sometimes tongue-tie may not cause problems. Some cases may require a simple surgical procedure for correction.",Signs and symptoms of tongue-tie include: | Difficulty lifting the tongue to the upper teeth or moving the tongue from side to side. | Trouble sticking out the tongue past the lower front teeth. | A tongue that appears notched or heart shaped when stuck out.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tongue-tie/symptoms-causes/syc-20378452

Anorexia nervosa,"Anorexia (an-o-REK-see-uh) nervosa, often simply called anorexia, is a treatable eating disorder in which people have a low body weight based on personal weight history. Although many people with anorexia look very thin, some may not look thin and others may look overweight. But they've actually lost weight or failed to gain needed weight.
People who have anorexia often have a strong fear of gaining weight and may think they're overweight, even when they're thin. To prevent weight gain or continue to lose weight, people with anorexia often limit the amount or type of food they eat. They place a high value on controlling their weight and shape and use extreme efforts that can greatly harm their lives.
Anorexia can cause changes in the brain due to very poor nutrition, also called malnutrition. This is when people don't get the nutrients that their bodies need to stay healthy. So it's not a choice to continue the risky and damaging behavior.
If left untreated, weight loss can get to a point where people with anorexia are at high risk of serious physical harm or death. Anorexia has the second-highest death rate of any mental illness, surpassed only by opioid overdoses. Most deaths related to anorexia stem from heart conditions and suicide.
Anorexia, like other eating disorders, can take over people's lives and be very hard to overcome. Because it's related to changes in the brain, anorexia behaviors are not choices, and the illness is not really about food or looking a certain way. With proven treatment, people with anorexia can return to a healthy weight, develop more-balanced eating habits, and reverse some of anorexia's serious medical and mental health complications.","The physical and behavioral symptoms of anorexia nervosa relate to how starvation affects the brain. It may be hard to notice symptoms because what is seen as a low body weight differs for each person. Some people with anorexia may not look very thin. Also, people often hide their thinness, eating habits or physical problems.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anorexia-nervosa/symptoms-causes/syc-20353591
Anterior vaginal prolapse (cystocele),"Anterior vaginal prolapse, also known as a cystocele (SIS-toe-seel) or a prolapsed bladder, is when the bladder drops from its usual position in the pelvis and pushes on the wall of the vagina.
The organs of the pelvis — including the bladder, uterus and intestines — are typically held in place by the muscles and connective tissues of the pelvic floor. Anterior prolapse occurs when the pelvic floor becomes weak or if too much pressure is put on the pelvic floor. This can happen over time, during vaginal childbirth or with chronic constipation, violent coughing or heavy lifting.
Anterior prolapse is treatable. For a mild or moderate prolapse, nonsurgical treatment is often effective. In more severe cases, surgery may be necessary to keep the vagina and other pelvic organs in their proper positions.","In mild cases of anterior prolapse, you may not notice any signs or symptoms. When signs and symptoms occur, they may include: | A feeling of fullness or pressure in your pelvis and vagina | In some cases, a bulge of tissue in your vagina that you can see or feel | Increased pelvic pressure when you strain, cough, bear down or lift | Problems urinating, including difficulty starting a urine stream, the feeling that you haven't completely emptied your bladder after urinating, feeling a frequent need to urinate or leaking urine (urinary incontinence) | Signs and symptoms often are especially noticeable after standing for long periods of time and may go away when you lie down.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cystocele/symptoms-causes/syc-20369452

Antisocial personality disorder,"Antisocial personality disorder, sometimes called sociopathy, is a mental health condition in which a person consistently shows no regard for right and wrong and ignores the rights and feelings of others. People with antisocial personality disorder tend to purposely make others angry or upset and manipulate or treat others harshly or with cruel indifference. They lack remorse or do not regret their behavior.
People with antisocial personality disorder often violate the law, becoming criminals. They may lie, behave violently or impulsively, and have problems with drug and alcohol use. They have difficulty consistently meeting responsibilities related to family, work or school.","Symptoms of antisocial personality disorder include repeatedly: | Ignoring right and wrong. | Telling lies to take advantage of others. | Not being sensitive to or respectful of others. | Using charm or wit to manipulate others for personal gain or pleasure. | Having a sense of superiority and being extremely opinionated. | Having problems with the law, including criminal behavior. | Being hostile, aggressive, violent or threatening to others. | Feeling no guilt about harming others. | Doing dangerous things with no regard for the safety of self or others. | Being irresponsible and failing to fulfill work or financial responsibilities. | Adults with antisocial personality disorder usually show symptoms of conduct disorder before the age of 15. Symptoms of conduct disorder include serious, ongoing behavior problems, such as: | Aggression toward people and animals. | Destruction of property. | Lying and dishonesty. | Theft. | Serious violation of rules. | Antisocial personality disorder is considered a lifelong condition. But in some people, certain symptoms ― particularly destructive and criminal behavior ― may decrease over time. It's not clear whether this decrease is a result of the effect aging has on their mind and body, an increased awareness of the impact that antisocial behavior has had on their life, or other factors.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20353928
Generalized anxiety disorder,"It's normal to feel anxious from time to time, especially if your life is stressful. However, excessive, ongoing anxiety and worry that are difficult to control and interfere with day-to-day activities may be a sign of generalized anxiety disorder.
It's possible to develop generalized anxiety disorder as a child or an adult. Generalized anxiety disorder has symptoms that are similar to panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and other types of anxiety, but they're all different conditions.
Living with generalized anxiety disorder can be a long-term challenge. In many cases, it occurs along with other anxiety or mood disorders. In most cases, generalized anxiety disorder improves with psychotherapy or medications. Making lifestyle changes, learning coping skills and using relaxation techniques also can help.","Generalized anxiety disorder symptoms can vary. They may include: | Persistent worrying or anxiety about a number of areas that are out of proportion to the impact of the events | Overthinking plans and solutions to all possible worst-case outcomes | Perceiving situations and events as threatening, even when they aren't | Difficulty handling uncertainty | Indecisiveness and fear of making the wrong decision | Inability to set aside or let go of a worry | Inability to relax, feeling restless, and feeling keyed up or on edge | Difficulty concentrating, or the feeling that your mind ""goes blank"" | Physical signs and symptoms may include: | Fatigue | Trouble sleeping | Muscle tension or muscle aches | Trembling, feeling twitchy | Nervousness or being easily startled | Sweating | Nausea, diarrhea or irritable bowel syndrome | Irritability | There may be times when your worries don't completely consume you, but you still feel anxious even when there's no apparent reason.

Social anxiety disorder (social phobia),"It's normal to feel nervous in some social situations. For example, going on a date or giving a presentation may cause that feeling of butterflies in your stomach. But in social anxiety disorder, also called social phobia, everyday interactions cause significant anxiety, self-consciousness and embarrassment because you fear being scrutinized or judged negatively by others.
In social anxiety disorder, fear and anxiety lead to avoidance that can disrupt your life. Severe stress can affect your relationships, daily routines, work, school or other activities.
Social anxiety disorder can be a chronic mental health condition, but learning coping skills in psychotherapy and taking medications can help you gain confidence and improve your ability to interact with others.","Feelings of shyness or discomfort in certain situations aren't necessarily signs of social anxiety disorder, particularly in children. Comfort levels in social situations vary, depending on personality traits and life experiences. Some people are naturally reserved and others are more outgoing. | In contrast to everyday nervousness, social anxiety disorder includes fear, anxiety and avoidance that interfere with relationships, daily routines, work, school or other activities.

Anxiety disorders,"Experiencing occasional anxiety is a normal part of life. However, people with anxiety disorders frequently have intense, excessive and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations. Often, anxiety disorders involve repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks).
These feelings of anxiety and panic interfere with daily activities, are difficult to control, are out of proportion to the actual danger and can last a long time. You may avoid places or situations to prevent these feelings. Symptoms may start during childhood or the teen years and continue into adulthood.
Examples of anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), specific phobias and separation anxiety disorder. You can have more than one anxiety disorder. Sometimes anxiety results from a medical condition that needs treatment.

Coarctation of the aorta,"Aortic coarctation (ko-ahrk-TAY-shun) is a narrowing of a part of the body's main artery, called the aorta. The condition forces the heart to work harder to pump blood.
Coarctation of the aorta is usually present at birth. That means it is a congenital heart defect. But sometimes the condition can occur later in life.
Coarctation of the aorta often occurs along with other congenital heart defects. Treatment to fix the condition is usually successful.

Aortic valve regurgitation,"Aortic valve regurgitation — also called aortic regurgitation — is a type of heart valve disease. The valve between the lower left heart chamber and the body's main artery doesn't close tightly. As a result, some of the blood pumped out of the heart's main pumping chamber, called the left ventricle, leaks backward.
The leakage may prevent the heart from doing a good enough job of pumping blood to the rest of the body. You may feel tired and short of breath.
Aortic valve regurgitation can develop suddenly or over many years. Once the condition becomes severe, surgery often is needed to repair or replace the valve.","Most often, aortic valve regurgitation develops over time. You may have no symptoms for years. You might not realize that you have the condition. But sometimes, aortic valve regurgitation occurs suddenly. Usually, this is due to an infection of the valve. | As aortic valve regurgitation becomes worse, symptoms may include: | Shortness of breath with exercise or when lying down. | Tiredness and weakness, especially when being more active than usual. | Irregular heartbeat. | Lightheadedness or fainting. | Pain, discomfort or tightness in the chest, which often gets worse during exercise. | Sensations of a rapid, fluttering heartbeat, called palpitations. | Swollen ankles and feet.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aortic-valve-regurgitation/symptoms-causes/syc-20353129
Aortic valve disease,"Aortic valve disease is a type of heart valve disease. In this condition, the valve between the lower left heart chamber and the body's main artery doesn't work properly.

Most canker sores go away on their own in a week or two. Check with your doctor or dentist if you have unusually large or painful canker sores or canker sores that don't seem to heal.","Most canker sores are round or oval with a white or yellow center and a red border. They form inside your mouth — on or under your tongue, inside your cheeks or lips, at the base of your gums, or on your soft palate. You might notice a tingling or burning sensation a day or two before the sores actually appear. | There are several types of canker sores, including minor, major and herpetiform sores.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/canker-sore/symptoms-causes/syc-20370615
Broken heart syndrome,"Broken heart syndrome is a heart condition that's often brought on by stressful situations and extreme emotions. The condition also can be triggered by a serious physical illness or surgery. Broken heart syndrome is usually temporary. But some people may continue to feel unwell after the heart is healed.
People with broken heart syndrome may have sudden chest pain or think they're having a heart attack. Broken heart syndrome affects just part of the heart. It briefly interrupts the way the heart pumps blood. The rest of the heart continues to work as usual. Sometimes the heart contracts more forcefully.
Medicines are used to treat symptoms of broken heart syndrome.
Broken heart syndrome also may be called:",Symptoms of broken heart syndrome can mimic those of a heart attack. Symptoms may include: | Chest pain. | Shortness of breath.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-heart-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20354617
Appendicitis,"Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix. The appendix is a finger-shaped pouch that sticks out from the colon on the lower right side of the belly, also called the abdomen.
Appendicitis causes pain in the lower right part of the belly. However, in most people, pain begins around the belly button and then moves. As inflammation worsens, appendicitis pain typically increases and eventually becomes serious.
Although anyone can develop appendicitis, most often it happens in people between the ages of 10 and 30. Treatment of appendicitis is usually antibiotics and, in most instances, surgery to remove the appendix.","Symptoms of appendicitis may include: | Sudden pain that begins on the right side of the lower belly. | Sudden pain that begins around the belly button and often shifts to the lower right belly. | Pain that worsens with coughing, walking or making other jarring movements. | Nausea and vomiting. | Loss of appetite. | Low-grade fever that may rise as the illness worsens. | Constipation or diarrhea. | Belly bloating. | Gas. | The site of the pain may vary, depending on age and the position of the appendix. In pregnancy, the pain may seem to come from the upper belly because the appendix is higher during pregnancy.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/appendicitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20369543
Viral hemorrhagic fevers,"Viral hemorrhagic (hem-uh-RAJ-ik) fevers are infectious diseases that can be life-threatening. They can damage the walls of tiny blood vessels, making them leak. And they can keep the blood from clotting.
Some viral hemorrhagic fevers include:
These diseases most often happen in tropical areas, such as Central Africa. In the United States, most people who get them have traveled to one of those areas.
There are vaccines and treatments for only a few types of viral hemorrhagic fevers. Until there are vaccines for more of them, do your best to keep from getting viral hemorrhagic fevers.","Symptoms of viral hemorrhagic fevers vary by disease. Mainly, early symptoms can include: | Fever. | Tiredness, weakness or feeling unwell. | Muscle, bone or joint aches. | Nausea and vomiting. | Diarrhea.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/viral-hemorrhagic-fevers/symptoms-causes/syc-20351260
Broken arm,"A broken arm involves one or more of the three bones in your arm — the ulna, radius and humerus. One of the most common causes of a broken arm is falling onto an outstretched hand. If you think you or your child has broken an arm, seek prompt medical attention. It's important to treat a fracture as soon as possible for proper healing.
Treatment depends on the site and severity of the injury. A simple break might be treated with a sling, ice and rest. However, the bone may require realignment (reduction) in the emergency room.
A more complicated break might require surgery to realign the broken bone and to implant wires, plates, nails or screws to keep the bone in place during healing.","A snap or cracking sound might be your first indication you've broken an arm. Signs and symptoms include: | Severe pain, which might increase with movement | Swelling | Bruising | Deformity, such as a bent arm or wrist | Inability to turn your arm from palm up to palm down or vice versa",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-arm/symptoms-causes/syc-20353260
Chiari malformation,"Chiari malformation (kee-AH-ree mal-for-MAY-shun) is a condition in which brain tissue extends into the spinal canal. It occurs when part of the skull is misshapen or smaller than is typical. The skull presses on the brain and forces it downward.
Chiari malformation is not common, but increased use of imaging tests has led to more diagnoses.
Health care professionals group Chiari malformation into three types. The type depends on the anatomy of the brain tissue that is pushed into the spinal canal. The type also depends on whether there are developmental changes of the brain or spine.
Chiari malformation type 1 develops as the skull and brain are growing. Symptoms may not occur until late childhood or adulthood. The pediatric forms of Chiari malformation are type 2 and type 3. These types are present at birth, which is known as congenital.
Treatment of Chiari malformation depends on the type and the symptoms. Regular monitoring, medicines and surgery are treatment options. Sometimes no treatment is needed.","Many people with Chiari malformation have no symptoms and don't need treatment. They learn they have Chiari malformation only when tests are performed for unrelated conditions. But some types of Chiari malfunction can cause symptoms. | The more common types of Chiari malformation are: | Type 1 | Type 2 | These types are less serious than the rarer pediatric form, type 3. But symptoms still can disrupt life.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chiari-malformation/symptoms-causes/syc-20354010
Heart arrhythmia,"A heart arrhythmia (uh-RITH-me-uh) is an irregular heartbeat. A heart arrhythmia occurs when the electrical signals that tell the heart to beat don't work properly. The heart may beat too fast or too slow. Or the pattern of the heartbeat may be inconsistent.
A heart arrhythmia may feel like a fluttering, pounding or racing heartbeat. Some heart arrhythmias are harmless. Others may cause life-threatening symptoms.
There are times when it is OK to have a fast or slow heartbeat. For example, the heart may beat faster with exercise or slow down during sleep.
Heart arrhythmia treatment may include medicines, devices such as pacemakers, or a procedure or surgery. The goals of treatment are to control or get rid of fast, slow or otherwise irregular heartbeats. A heart-healthy lifestyle can help prevent heart damage that can trigger some heart arrhythmias.","A heart arrhythmia may not cause any symptoms. The irregular heartbeat may be noticed during a health checkup for another reason. | Symptoms of an arrhythmia may include: | A fluttering, pounding or racing feeling in the chest. | A fast heartbeat. | A slow heartbeat. | Chest pain. | Shortness of breath. | Other symptoms may include: | Anxiety. | Feeling very tired. | Lightheadedness or dizziness. | Sweating. | Fainting or almost fainting.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-arrhythmia/symptoms-causes/syc-20350668
Arteriosclerosis / atherosclerosis,"Arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis are sometimes used to mean the same thing. But there's a difference between the two terms.
Arteriosclerosishappens when the blood vessels that carry oxygen and nutrients from the heart to the rest of the body become thick and stiff. These blood vessels are called arteries. Healthy arteries are flexible and elastic. But over time, the walls in the arteries can harden, a condition commonly called hardening of the arteries.
Atherosclerosisis a specific type of arteriosclerosis.
Atherosclerosis is the buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the artery walls. This buildup is called plaque. The plaque can cause arteries to narrow, blocking blood flow. The plaque also can burst, leading to a blood clot.
Although atherosclerosis is often considered a heart condition, it can affect arteries anywhere in the body. Atherosclerosis can be treated. Healthy lifestyle habits can help prevent atherosclerosis.","Mild atherosclerosis usually doesn't cause symptoms. | Atherosclerosis symptoms usually don't happen until an artery is so narrowed or clogged that it can't send enough blood to organs and tissues. Sometimes a blood clot completely blocks blood flow. The clot may break apart. If this happens, it may cause a heart attack or stroke. | Symptoms of moderate to severe atherosclerosis depend on which arteries are affected. For example, if you have atherosclerosis: | In your heart arteries,you may have chest pain or pressure, called angina. | In the arteries leading to your brain,you may have sudden numbness or weakness in your arms or legs, trouble speaking, slurred speech, sudden or temporary loss of vision in one eye, or drooping muscles in your face. These are symptoms of a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Untreated, a TIA can lead to a stroke. | In the arteries in your arms and legs,you may have leg pain when walking, called claudication. This is a symptom of peripheral artery disease (PAD). You also might have lower blood pressure in the affected arm or leg. | In the arteries leading to your kidneys,you may get high blood pressure or kidney failure.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569
Arteriovenous fistula,,,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriovenous-fistula/symptoms-causes/syc-20369567
Arteriovenous malformation,"An arteriovenous malformation, also known as an AVM, is a tangle of blood vessels that creates irregular connections between arteries and veins. This disrupts blood flow and prevents tissues from receiving oxygen. AnAVMcan occur anywhere in the body, including in the brain.
Arteries move oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the brain and other organs. Veins drain the oxygen-depleted blood back to the lungs and heart. When anAVMdisrupts this critical process, surrounding tissues might not get enough oxygen.
Because the tangled blood vessels in anAVMdo not form properly, they can weaken and burst. If anAVMin the brain bursts, it can cause bleeding in the brain, which can lead to a stroke or brain damage. Bleeding in the brain is known as a hemorrhage.
Read more aboutbrain AVM (arteriovenous malformation).
The cause ofAVMsis not clear. Rarely, they are passed down in families.
Once diagnosed, a brainAVMoften can be treated to prevent or reduce the risk of complications.","Symptoms of an arteriovenous malformation, also known as an AVM, can vary. Sometimes anAVMdoesn't cause symptoms. TheAVMcan be found while getting images for another health concern. | Often the first symptoms appear after bleeding occurs. Besides bleeding, symptoms can include: | Trouble with thinking that gets worse over time. | Headaches. | Nausea and vomiting. | Seizures. | Loss of consciousness. | Other possible symptoms include: | Weak muscles, such as weakness in the legs. | Loss of movement and feeling in one part of the body, known as paralysis. | Loss of coordination that can cause trouble with walking. | Trouble doing tasks that require planning. | Back pain. | Dizziness. | Vision problems. This may include losing part of the field of vision, trouble moving the eyes or swelling of part of the optic nerve. | Trouble with speech or understanding language. | Numbness, tingling or sudden pain. | Memory loss or dementia. | Seeing or hearing things that aren't there, known as hallucinations. | Confusion. | Children and teens might have trouble with learning or behavior. | One type ofAVMcalled a vein of Galen malformation causes symptoms that appear at or shortly after birth. A vein of Galen malformation occurs deep inside the brain. Signs can include: | A buildup of fluid in the brain that causes the head to be larger than usual. | Swollen veins on the scalp. | Seizures. | Failure to thrive. | Congestive heart failure.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriovenous-malformation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350544
Giant cell arteritis,"Giant cell arteritis is an inflammation of the lining of your arteries. Most often, it affects the arteries in your head, especially those in your temples. For this reason, giant cell arteritis is sometimes called temporal arteritis.
Giant cell arteritis frequently causes headaches, scalp tenderness, jaw pain and vision problems. Untreated, it can lead to blindness.
Prompt treatment with corticosteroid medications usually relieves symptoms of giant cell arteritis and might prevent loss of vision. You'll likely begin to feel better within days of starting treatment. But even with treatment, relapses are common.
You'll need to visit your doctor regularly for checkups and treatment of any side effects from taking corticosteroids.","The most common symptoms of giant cell arteritis are head pain and tenderness — often severe — that usually affects both temples. Head pain can progressively worsen, come and go, or subside temporarily. | Generally, signs and symptoms of giant cell arteritis include: | Persistent, severe head pain, usually in your temple area | Scalp tenderness | Jaw pain when you chew or open your mouth wide | Fever | Fatigue | Unintended weight loss | Vision loss or double vision, particularly in people who also have jaw pain | Sudden, permanent loss of vision in one eye | Pain and stiffness in the neck, shoulders or hips are common symptoms of a related disorder, polymyalgia rheumatica.

Arthritis,"Arthritis is the swelling and tenderness of one or more joints. The main symptoms of arthritis are joint pain and stiffness, which typically worsen with age. The most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
Osteoarthritis causes cartilage — the hard, slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones where they form a joint — to break down. Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease in which the immune system attacks the joints, beginning with the lining of joints.
Uric acid crystals, which form when there's too much uric acid in your blood, can cause gout. Infections or underlying disease, such as psoriasis or lupus, can cause other types of arthritis.
Treatments vary depending on the type of arthritis. The main goals of arthritis treatments are to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life.","The most common signs and symptoms of arthritis involve the joints. Depending on the type of arthritis, signs and symptoms may include: | Pain | Stiffness | Swelling | Redness | Decreased range of motion",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350772
Thumb arthritis,"Thumb arthritis is common with aging and occurs when cartilage wears away from the ends of the bones that form the joint at the base of your thumb — also known as the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint.
Thumb arthritis can cause severe pain, swelling, and decreased strength and range of motion, making it difficult to do simple tasks, such as turning doorknobs and opening jars. Treatment generally involves a combination of medication and splints. Severe thumb arthritis might require surgery.","Pain is the first and most common symptom of thumb arthritis. Pain can occur at the base of your thumb when you grip, grasp or pinch an object, or use your thumb to apply force. | Other signs and symptoms might include: | Swelling, stiffness and tenderness at the base of your thumb | Decreased strength when pinching or grasping objects | Decreased range of motion | Enlarged or bony appearance of the joint at the base of your thumb",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thumb-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20378339

Gout,"Gout is a common and complex form of arthritis that can affect anyone. It's characterized by sudden, severe attacks of pain, swelling, redness and tenderness in one or more joints, most often in the big toe.
An attack of gout can occur suddenly, often waking you up in the middle of the night with the sensation that your big toe is on fire. The affected joint is hot, swollen and so tender that even the weight of the bedsheet on it may seem intolerable.
Gout symptoms may come and go, but there are ways to manage symptoms and prevent flares.","The signs and symptoms of gout almost always occur suddenly, and often at night. They include: | Intense joint pain.Gout usually affects the big toe, but it can occur in any joint. Other commonly affected joints include the ankles, knees, elbows, wrists and fingers. The pain is likely to be most severe within the first four to 12 hours after it begins. | Lingering discomfort.After the most severe pain subsides, some joint discomfort may last from a few days to a few weeks. Later attacks are likely to last longer and affect more joints. | Inflammation and redness.The affected joint or joints become swollen, tender, warm and red. | Limited range of motion.As gout progresses, you may not be able to move your joints normally.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gout/symptoms-causes/syc-20372897

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, formerly known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, is the most common type of arthritis in children under the age of 16.
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis can cause persistent joint pain, swelling and stiffness. Some children may experience symptoms for only a few months, while others have symptoms for many years.
Some types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis can cause serious complications, such as growth problems, joint damage and eye inflammation. Treatment focuses on controlling pain and inflammation, improving function, and preventing damage.","The most common signs and symptoms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis are: | Pain.While your child might not complain of joint pain, you may notice that he or she limps — especially first thing in the morning or after a nap. | Swelling.Joint swelling is common but is often first noticed in larger joints such as the knee. | Stiffness.You might notice that your child appears clumsier than usual, particularly in the morning or after naps. | Fever, swollen lymph nodes and rash.In some cases, high fever, swollen lymph nodes or a rash on the trunk may occur — which is usually worse in the evenings. | Juvenile idiopathic arthritis can affect one joint or many. There are several different subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, but the main ones are systemic, oligoarticular and polyarticular. Which type your child has depends on symptoms, the number of joints affected, and if a fever and rashes are prominent features. | Like other forms of arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis is characterized by times when symptoms flare up and times when symptoms may be minimal.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20374082

Rheumatoid arthritis,"Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can affect more than just your joints. In some people, the condition can damage a wide variety of body systems, including the skin, eyes, lungs, heart and blood vessels.
An autoimmune disorder, rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system mistakenly attacks your own body's tissues.
Unlike the wear-and-tear damage of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis affects the lining of your joints, causing a painful swelling that can eventually result in bone erosion and joint deformity.
The inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis is what can damage other parts of the body as well. While new types of medications have improved treatment options dramatically, severe rheumatoid arthritis can still cause physical disabilities.","Signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include: | Tender, warm, swollen joints | Joint stiffness that is usually worse in the mornings and after inactivity | Fatigue, fever and loss of appetite | Early rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect your smaller joints first — particularly the joints that attach your fingers to your hands and your toes to your feet. | As the disease progresses, symptoms often spread to the wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, hips and shoulders. In most cases, symptoms occur in the same joints on both sides of your body. | About 40% of people who have rheumatoid arthritis also experience signs and symptoms that don't involve the joints. Areas that may be affected include: | Skin | Eyes | Lungs | Heart | Kidneys | Salivary glands | Nerve tissue | Bone marrow | Blood vessels | Rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms may vary in severity and may even come and go. Periods of increased disease activity, called flares, alternate with periods of relative remission — when the swelling and pain fade or disappear.

Atrial septal defect (ASD),"An atrial septal defect (ASD) is a heart condition that you're born with. That means it's a congenital heart defect. People with anASDhave a hole between the upper heart chambers. The hole increases the amount of blood going through the lungs.
Small atrial septal defects might be found by chance and never cause a concern. Others might close during infancy or early childhood.
A large, long-term atrial septal defect can damage the heart and lungs. Surgery may be needed to repair an atrial septal defect and to prevent complications.","A baby born with an atrial septal defect (ASD) may not have symptoms. Symptoms may begin in adulthood. | Atrial septal defect symptoms may include: | Shortness of breath, especially when exercising. | Tiredness, especially with activity. | Swelling of the legs, feet or belly area. | Irregular heartbeats, also called arrhythmias. | Skipped heartbeats or feelings of a quick, pounding or fluttering heartbeat, called palpitations.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-septal-defect/symptoms-causes/syc-20369715

Asthma,"Asthma is a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and may produce extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, a whistling sound (wheezing) when you breathe out and shortness of breath.
For some people, asthma is a minor nuisance. For others, it can be a major problem that interferes with daily activities and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack.
Asthma can't be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled. Because asthma often changes over time, it's important that you work with your doctor to track your signs and symptoms and adjust your treatment as needed.","Asthma symptoms vary from person to person. You may have infrequent asthma attacks, have symptoms only at certain times — such as when exercising — or have symptoms all the time. | Asthma signs and symptoms include: | Shortness of breath | Chest tightness or pain | Wheezing when exhaling, which is a common sign of asthma in children | Trouble sleeping caused by shortness of breath, coughing or wheezing | Coughing or wheezing attacks that are worsened by a respiratory virus, such as a cold or the flu | Signs that your asthma is probably worsening include: | Asthma signs and symptoms that are more frequent and bothersome | Increasing difficulty breathing, as measured with a device used to check how well your lungs are working (peak flow meter) | The need to use a quick-relief inhaler more often | For some people, asthma signs and symptoms flare up in certain situations: | Exercise-induced asthma,which may be worse when the air is cold and dry | Occupational asthma,triggered by workplace irritants such as chemical fumes, gases or dust | Allergy-induced asthma,triggered by airborne substances, such as pollen, mold spores, cockroach waste, or particles of skin and dried saliva shed by pets (pet dander)",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/asthma/symptoms-causes/syc-20369653
Asthma attack,"An asthma attack is a sudden worsening of asthma symptoms. Asthma is a long-term condition that makes breathing difficult because airways in the lungs become narrow. Symptoms of asthma attack include coughing, wheezing, tightness in the chest and difficulty getting enough air.
These symptoms happen because muscles around airways tighten up, the airways become irritated and swollen, and the lining of the airways produces a fluid called mucus. All of these factors make it difficult to breathe.
People who already have a diagnosis of asthma usually have an asthma action plan. This tells them what medicines to take if they have an asthma attack and when to get emergency care. People who do not have a diagnosis or don't have a treatment plan should get emergency care if they have these symptoms.
Frequent asthma attacks show that a person's asthma is not under control. A healthcare professional might make changes in medicines and the asthma action plan to improve control.
An asthma attack also is called an asthma exacerbation or asthma flare-up.","Symptoms of asthma attacks may include: | Shortness of breath. | Chest tightness or pain. | Coughing. | Wheezing. | Severe symptoms also may include: | Gasping for breath. | Difficulty speaking because of shortness of breath. | Straining of chest muscles to breathe. | Worse symptoms when lying on the back. | Severe sweating. | The result of an at-home test, called a peak flow meter, can be an important sign of an asthma attack. This device measures how quickly you can force air out of your lungs. Peak flow readings are usually a percentage of how your lungs work at their best. This is called your personal best peak flow. | An asthma action plan often includes steps to take based on a peak flow reading. A reading below 80% of a best peak flow can be a sign of an asthma attack.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/asthma-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20354268

Occupational asthma,"Occupational asthma is a type of asthma caused by breathing in fumes, gases, dust or other substances while on the job. These substances can trigger an immune system response that changes how the lungs work. Occupational asthma also is called work-related asthma.
In asthma, the airways narrow and swell. They also may make extra mucus. This makes it difficult to breathe and may cause chest tightness, wheezing and shortness of breath.
Avoiding triggers is important for managing occupational asthma. Treatment includes medicines that reduce symptoms. For people who were diagnosed with asthma in the past, medicines may help improve symptoms related to workplace triggers.
If occupational asthma is not treated and triggers are not avoided, the asthma can cause permanent changes to the lungs.","Occupational asthma symptoms may include: | Wheezing. | Coughing. | Shortness of breath. | Chest tightness. | Other possible symptoms may include: | Runny nose. | Stuffy nose. | Itchy or watery eyes. | Occupational asthma symptoms depend on the substance you're exposed to, how long and how often you're exposed, and other factors. Your symptoms may: | Begin right after exposure to a substance, later in the day or after work. | Improve or go away on days off or during vacations and then return when you go to work. | May begin early in the day and fail to improve on days off as disease progresses. | May become permanent even after long periods away from work.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/occupational-asthma/symptoms-causes/syc-20375772

Atrial tachycardia,"Atrial tachycardia is an irregular heartbeat, called an arrhythmia. It's a type of supraventricular tachycardia.
During an atrial tachycardia episode, the heart beats more than 100 times a minute. Then it returns to a heart rate of around 60 to 80 beats a minute. An episode may start slowly, or it may start suddenly and quickly. It can cause a pounding or racing heartbeat, lightheadedness, dizziness, and fainting.
Atrial tachycardia is common. It may happen in people who have had heart surgery or who are pregnant. Infections, stimulant medicines or alcohol use may trigger it.","The main symptom of atrial tachycardia is a very fast heartbeat. Typically during atrial tachycardia, the heart beats 150 to 200 times a minute. The fast heartbeat may come and go suddenly, or it can be ongoing. | Other symptoms of atrial tachycardia may include: | Pounding or fluttering feelings in the chest or neck, called palpitations. | Chest pain. | Fainting or almost fainting. | Lightheadedness or dizziness. | Shortness of breath. | Sweating. | Weakness or extreme tiredness. | Nausea. | Some people with atrial tachycardia do not notice symptoms. | Atrial tachycardia symptoms may be hard to see in infants and young children.

Ataxia,"Ataxia describes poor muscle control that causes clumsy movements. It can affect walking and balance, hand coordination, speech and swallowing, and eye movements.
Ataxia usually results from damage to the part of the brain called the cerebellum or its connections. The cerebellum controls muscle coordination. Many conditions can cause ataxia, including genetic conditions, stroke, tumors, multiple sclerosis, degenerative diseases and alcohol misuse. Certain medicines also can cause ataxia.
Treatment for ataxia depends on the cause. Devices such as walkers and canes might help maintain independence. These also are called adaptive devices. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and regular exercise also might help.","Ataxia symptoms can develop over time or start suddenly. Ataxia can be a symptom of several nervous system conditions. Symptoms may include: | Poor coordination. | Walking unsteadily or with the feet set wide apart. | Poor balance. | Trouble with fine motor tasks such as eating, writing or buttoning a shirt. | Changes in speech. | Back-and-forth eye movements that can't be controlled. | Trouble swallowing.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ataxia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355652
Atelectasis,"Atelectasis (at-uh-LEK-tuh-sis) is the collapse of a lung or part of a lung, also known as a lobe. It happens when tiny air sacs within the lung, called alveoli, lose air.
Atelectasis is one of the most common breathing complications after surgery. It's also a possible complication of other respiratory problems, including cystic fibrosis, lung tumors, chest injuries, fluid in the lung and respiratory weakness. You may develop atelectasis if you breathe in a foreign object.
This condition can make breathing hard, particularly if you already have lung disease. Treatment depends on what's causing the collapse and how severe it is.
The definition of atelectasis is broader than pneumothorax (noo-moe-THOR-aks). Pneumothorax is when air leaks into the space between your lungs and chest wall, causing part or all of a lung to collapse. Pneumothorax is one of several causes of atelectasis.","There may be no clear signs of atelectasis. If you have any signs, they may include: | Having a hard time breathing. | Rapid, weak breathing. | Wheezing. | Coughing.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atelectasis/symptoms-causes/syc-20369684
Athlete's foot,"Athlete's foot (tinea pedis) is a fungal skin infection that usually begins between the toes. It commonly occurs in people whose feet have become very sweaty while confined within tight-fitting shoes.
Signs and symptoms of athlete's foot include an itchy, scaly rash. The condition is contagious and can be spread via contaminated floors, towels or clothing.
Athlete's foot is closely related to other fungal infections such as ringworm and jock itch. It can be treated with antifungal medications, but the infection often comes back.","Athlete's foot can affect one or both feet.

Atopic dermatitis (eczema),"Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is a condition that causes dry, itchy and inflamed skin. It's common in young children but can occur at any age. Atopic dermatitis is long lasting (chronic) and tends to flare sometimes. It can be irritating but it's not contagious.
People with atopic dermatitis are at risk of developing food allergies, hay fever and asthma.
Moisturizing regularly and following other skin care habits can relieve itching and prevent new outbreaks (flares). Treatment may also include medicated ointments or creams.","Atopic dermatitis (eczema) symptoms can appear anywhere on the body and vary widely from person to person. They may include: | Dry, cracked skin | Itchiness (pruritus) | Rash on swollen skin that varies in color depending on your skin color | Small, raised bumps, on brown or Black skin | Oozing and crusting | Thickened skin | Darkening of the skin around the eyes | Raw, sensitive skin from scratching | Atopic dermatitis often begins before age 5 and may continue into the teen and adult years.

Atrial flutter,"Atrial flutter is a type of heart rhythm disorder, called an arrhythmia. It is similar to atrial fibrillation (AFib). But in atrial flutter the heart rhythm is more organized and less chaotic than in AFib. A person can have both atrial flutter and AFib.
Atrial flutter may not cause symptoms. But some people may have a pounding, rapid heartbeat and chest pain. Fainting or almost fainting also may happen. Treatment for atrial flutter may include medicines and a heart procedure.","People with atrial flutter may not have symptoms. The irregular heartbeat may be found during a health checkup for another reason. | If atrial flutter symptoms happen, they may include: | A pounding or racing feeling in the chest. | Chest pain. | Fainting or almost fainting. | Shortness of breath. | Feeling very tired.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-flutter/symptoms-causes/syc-20352586

Atypical hyperplasia of the breast,"Atypical hyperplasia of the breast is the development of precancerous cells in the breast. Atypical hyperplasia causes a buildup of cells in the breast tissue. When viewed with a microscope, the cells look different from typical breast cells.
Atypical hyperplasia of the breast isn't breast cancer. But it's a sign that you have an increased risk of breast cancer in the future.
Your healthcare team creates a plan to help you manage your risk of breast cancer. Often this includes more-frequent breast cancer screening tests. You also might consider medicines to reduce breast cancer risk.","Atypical hyperplasia of the breast usually doesn't cause any symptoms. | Atypical hyperplasia of the breast is typically found during a breast biopsy. A breast biopsy is a procedure to remove some breast cells for testing. It's often recommended if something concerning is found on a mammogram or an ultrasound. A biopsy also might be done to investigate a breast concern, such as a lump.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atypical-hyperplasia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369773
Autism spectrum disorder,"Autism spectrum disorder is a condition related to brain development that impacts how a person perceives and socializes with others, causing problems in social interaction and communication. The disorder also includes limited and repetitive patterns of behavior. The term ""spectrum"" in autism spectrum disorder refers to the wide range of symptoms and severity.
Autism spectrum disorder includes conditions that were previously considered separate — autism, Asperger's syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder and an unspecified form of pervasive developmental disorder. Some people still use the term ""Asperger's syndrome,"" which is generally thought to be at the mild end of autism spectrum disorder.
Autism spectrum disorder begins in early childhood and eventually causes problems functioning in society — socially, in school and at work, for example. Often children show symptoms of autism within the first year. A small number of children appear to develop normally in the first year, and then go through a period of regression between 18 and 24 months of age when they develop autism symptoms.
While there is no cure for autism spectrum disorder, intensive, early treatment can make a big difference in the lives of many children.","Some children show signs of autism spectrum disorder in early infancy, such as reduced eye contact, lack of response to their name or indifference to caregivers. Other children may develop normally for the first few months or years of life, but then suddenly become withdrawn or aggressive or lose language skills they've already acquired. Signs usually are seen by age 2 years. | Each child with autism spectrum disorder is likely to have a unique pattern of behavior and level of severity — from low functioning to high functioning. | Some children with autism spectrum disorder have difficulty learning, and some have signs of lower than normal intelligence. Other children with the disorder have normal to high intelligence — they learn quickly, yet have trouble communicating and applying what they know in everyday life and adjusting to social situations. | Because of the unique mixture of symptoms in each child, severity can sometimes be difficult to determine. It's generally based on the level of impairments and how they impact the ability to function. | Below are some common signs shown by people who have autism spectrum disorder.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autism-spectrum-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20352928
Autoimmune hepatitis,"Autoimmune hepatitis is a liver disease that happens when the body's immune system attacks the liver. This can cause swelling, irritation and damage to the liver. The exact cause of autoimmune hepatitis is unclear, but genetic and environmental factors appear to interact over time to trigger the disease.
Untreated autoimmune hepatitis can lead to scarring of the liver, called cirrhosis. It can also eventually lead to liver failure. When diagnosed and treated early, however, autoimmune hepatitis often can be controlled with medicines that suppress the immune system.
A liver transplant may be an option when autoimmune hepatitis doesn't respond to medicines or liver disease becomes advanced.","Symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis vary from person to person and may come on suddenly. Some people have few, if any, recognized problems in the early stages of the disease, whereas others experience symptoms that may include: | Fatigue. | Belly discomfort. | Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, called jaundice. Depending on skin color, this change may be harder or easier to see. | An enlarged liver. | Irregular blood vessels on the skin, called spider angiomas. | Skin rash. | Joint pain. | Loss of menstrual periods.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autoimmune-hepatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352153
Autoimmune pancreatitis,"Autoimmune pancreatitis is an inflammation in the pancreas. It may be caused by the immune system attacking the pancreas. Autoimmune pancreatitis also is called AIP. Two subtypes ofAIPare now recognized, type 1 and type 2.
Type 1AIPis called IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). This type often affects multiple organs, including the pancreas, bile ducts in the liver, salivary glands, kidneys and lymph nodes.
Type 2AIPseems to affect only the pancreas, although about one-third of people with type 2AIPhave associated inflammatory bowel disease.
Type 1AIPcan be mistakenly diagnosed as pancreatic cancer. The two conditions have overlapping symptoms, but very different treatments, so it is very important to distinguish one from the other.","Autoimmune pancreatitis, also called AIP, is difficult to diagnose. Often, it doesn't cause any symptoms. Symptoms of type 1AIPare like those of pancreatic cancer. | Pancreatic cancer symptoms can include: | Dark urine. | Pale stools or stools that float in the toilet. | Yellow skin and eyes, called jaundice. | Pain in your upper belly or middle part of your back. | Nausea and vomiting. | Weakness or extreme tiredness. | Loss of appetite or feelings of fullness. | Weight loss for no known reason. | The most common sign of type 1AIPis painless jaundice. About 80% of people with type 1AIPhave painless jaundice. This is caused by blocked bile ducts. People with type 2AIPcan have repeat episodes of acute pancreatitis. Pain in the upper abdomen, a common symptom of pancreatic cancer, is often absent in autoimmune pancreatitis. | Differences between type 1 and type 2AIPare: | In type 1AIP, the disease may affect other organs in addition to the pancreas. Type 2AIPaffects only the pancreas. Type 2 disease also is associated with another autoimmune condition called inflammatory bowel disease. | Type 1AIPmostly affects men in the sixth to seventh decade of life. | Type 2AIPaffects both men and women equally and has a younger age of onset compared with type 1AIP. | Type 1AIPis more likely to relapse after treatment is discontinued.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autoimmune-pancreatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20369800

Bird flu (avian influenza),"Bird flu, also called avian influenza, is caused by influenza type A virus infections in bird species. Depending on the strain, bird flu may cause the bird to have no symptoms, mild illness, serious illness or lead to the death of the bird.
Bird flu rarely infects humans. But health officials worry because influenza A viruses that infect birds can change, called mutate, to infect humans and spread from person to person more often. Because a new strain of bird flu would be a new virus to humans, a mutated strain like that could spread quickly around the world.
People most often catch a bird flu virus from close, long-term contact with live, domesticated poultry typically on farms or in backyard coops. People also may catch bird flu through contact with wild birds or another type of animal. Bird flu rarely has spread from person to person.
In humans, flu is a viral infection of the nose, throat and lungs, which are part of the respiratory system. Symptoms of bird flu in humans are similar to flu symptoms and may be mild to serious.","Bird flu symptoms can be mild to serious in a person. Symptoms typically show up within seven days of contact with the virus but can take as long as two weeks. A person can get infected from direct contact with an infected animal, or the bedding or stool of the animal. | Flu viruses have similar symptoms. So you need to be tested to check if you have a bird flu infection. | Common bird flu symptoms include: | Fever. | Problems breathing. | Pink eye, also called conjunctivitis. | Upset stomach and vomiting. | Loose stool, called diarrhea. | Bird flu may cause breathing problems more often than other kinds of flu. And during bird flu pandemics, the risk that a person with flu will need a machine to help them breathe is higher.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bird-flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20568390

Back pain,"Back pain is one of the most common reasons people seek medical help or miss work. Back pain is a leading cause of disability worldwide.
Fortunately, measures can help prevent or relieve most back pain episodes, especially for people younger than age 60. If prevention fails, simple home treatment and using the body correctly often can heal the back within a few weeks. Surgery is rarely needed to treat back pain.","Back pain can range from a muscle ache to a shooting, burning or stabbing feeling. Also, the pain can radiate down a leg. Bending, twisting, lifting, standing or walking can make pain worse.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/back-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20369906
Bacterial vaginosis,"Bacterial vaginosis (BV) can cause discomfort and pain of the vagina. It happens when natural bacteria levels are out of balance. Balanced levels of bacteria help keep the vagina healthy. But when too much of some bacteria grow, it can lead toBV.
Bacterial vaginosis can happen at any age. But it's most common during the reproductive years. The changes in hormones during this time make it easier for certain kinds of bacteria to grow. Also, bacterial vaginosis is more common among those who are sexually active. It's not clear why this is. But activities such as unprotected sex and douching raise your risk of havingBV.","Symptoms of bacterial vaginosis include: | Thin, vaginal discharge that may be gray, white or green. | Foul-smelling, ""fishy"" vaginal odor. | Vaginal itching. | Burning during urination. | Many people with bacterial vaginosis have no symptoms.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bacterial-vaginosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352279
Bad breath,"Bad breath, also called halitosis, can be embarrassing and in some cases may even cause anxiety. It's no wonder that store shelves are overflowing with gum, mints, mouthwashes and other products to fight bad breath. But many of these products are only short-term measures. That's because they don't address the cause of the problem.
Certain foods, health conditions and habits are among the causes of bad breath. In many cases, you can make bad breath better by keeping your mouth and teeth clean. If you can't solve bad breath yourself, see your dentist or another healthcare professional to be sure a more serious condition isn't causing it.","Bad breath odors vary, depending on the cause. Some people worry too much about their breath even though they have little or no mouth odor. Others have bad breath and don't know it. Because it's hard to know how your breath smells, ask a close friend or relative to confirm if you have bad breath.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bad-breath/symptoms-causes/syc-20350922
Bags under eyes,"Bags under eyes are mild swelling or puffiness under the eyes. They're common as you age and the tissues around your eyes weaken, including some of the muscles supporting your eyelids. Fat that helps support the eyes can then move into the lower eyelids, causing them to appear puffy. Fluid may also accumulate below your eyes.
Bags under eyes are usually a cosmetic concern and rarely a sign of a serious condition. At-home remedies, such as cool compresses, can help improve their appearance. For persistent or bothersome under-eye puffiness, eyelid surgery may be an option.",Symptoms of bags under eyes can include: | Mild swelling | Saggy or loose skin | Dark circles,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bags-under-eyes/symptoms-causes/syc-20369927
Baker cyst,"A Baker cyst is a fluid-filled growth behind the knee. It causes a bulge and a feeling of tightness. Also called a popliteal (pop-luh-TEE-ul) cyst, a Baker cyst sometime causes pain. The pain can get worse when with activity or when fully straightening or bending the knee.
A Baker cyst is usually the result of a problem with the knee joint, such as arthritis or a cartilage tear. Both conditions can cause the knee to produce too much fluid.
Although a Baker cyst may cause swelling and discomfort, treating the underlying problem that is causing it usually provides relief.","In some cases, a Baker cyst causes no pain, and you may not notice it. If you do have symptoms, they might include: | Swelling behind the knee, and sometimes in the leg | Knee pain | Stiffness and inability to fully flex the knee | The symptoms may be worse after you've been active or if you've been standing for a long time.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bakers-cyst/symptoms-causes/syc-20369950
Balance problems,"Balance problems can make you feel dizzy, as if the room is spinning, unsteady, or lightheaded. You might feel as if the room is spinning or you're going to fall down. These feelings can happen whether you're lying down, sitting or standing.
Many body systems — including your muscles, bones, joints, eyes, the balance organ in the inner ear, nerves, heart and blood vessels — must work normally for you to have normal balance. When these systems aren't functioning well, you can experience balance problems.
Many medical conditions can cause balance problems. However, most balance problems result from issues in your balance organ in the inner ear (vestibular system).","Signs and symptoms of balance problems include: | Sense of motion or spinning (vertigo) | Feeling of faintness or lightheadedness (presyncope) | Loss of balance or unsteadiness | Falling or feeling like you might fall | Feeling a floating sensation or dizziness | Vision changes, such as blurriness | Confusion",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/balance-problems/symptoms-causes/syc-20350474
Hair loss,"Hair loss (alopecia) can affect just your scalp or your entire body, and it can be temporary or permanent. It can be the result of heredity, hormonal changes, medical conditions or a normal part of aging. Anyone can lose hair on their head, but it's more common in men.
Baldness typically refers to excessive hair loss from your scalp. Hereditary hair loss with age is the most common cause of baldness. Some people prefer to let their hair loss run its course untreated and unhidden. Others may cover it up with hairstyles, makeup, hats or scarves. And still others choose one of the treatments available to prevent further hair loss or restore growth.
Before pursuing hair loss treatment, talk with your doctor about the cause of your hair loss and treatment options.","Hair loss can appear in many different ways, depending on what's causing it. It can come on suddenly or gradually and affect just your scalp or your whole body. | Signs and symptoms of hair loss may include: | Gradual thinning on top of head.This is the most common type of hair loss, affecting people as they age. In men, hair often begins to recede at the hairline on the forehead. Women typically have a broadening of the part in their hair. An increasingly common hair loss pattern in older women is a receding hairline (frontal fibrosing alopecia). | Circular or patchy bald spots.Some people lose hair in circular or patchy bald spots on the scalp, beard or eyebrows. Your skin may become itchy or painful before the hair falls out. | Sudden loosening of hair.A physical or emotional shock can cause hair to loosen. Handfuls of hair may come out when combing or washing your hair or even after gentle tugging. This type of hair loss usually causes overall hair thinning but is temporary. | Full-body hair loss.Some conditions and medical treatments, such as chemotherapy for cancer, can result in the loss of hair all over your body. The hair usually grows back. | Patches of scaling that spread over the scalp.This is a sign of ringworm.

Barrett's esophagus,"Barrett's esophagus is a condition in which the flat pink lining of the swallowing tube that connects the mouth to the stomach (esophagus) becomes damaged by acid reflux, which causes the lining to thicken and become red.
Between the esophagus and the stomach is a critically important valve, the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Over time, theLESmay begin to fail, leading to acid and chemical damage of the esophagus, a condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).GERDis often accompanied by symptoms such as heartburn or regurgitation. In some people, thisGERDmay trigger a change in the cells lining the lower esophagus, causing Barrett's esophagus.
Barrett's esophagus is associated with an increased risk of developing esophageal cancer. Although the risk of developing esophageal cancer is small, it's important to have regular checkups with careful imaging and extensive biopsies of the esophagus to check for precancerous cells (dysplasia). If precancerous cells are discovered, they can be treated to prevent esophageal cancer.","The development of Barrett's esophagus is most often attributed to long-standingGERD, which may include these signs and symptoms: | Frequent heartburn and regurgitation of stomach contents | Difficulty swallowing food | Less commonly, chest pain | Curiously, approximately half of the people diagnosed with Barrett's esophagus report little if any symptoms of acid reflux.

Thumb arthritis,"Thumb arthritis is common with aging and occurs when cartilage wears away from the ends of the bones that form the joint at the base of your thumb — also known as the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint.
Thumb arthritis can cause severe pain, swelling, and decreased strength and range of motion, making it difficult to do simple tasks, such as turning doorknobs and opening jars. Treatment generally involves a combination of medication and splints. Severe thumb arthritis might require surgery.","Pain is the first and most common symptom of thumb arthritis. Pain can occur at the base of your thumb when you grip, grasp or pinch an object, or use your thumb to apply force. | Other signs and symptoms might include: | Swelling, stiffness and tenderness at the base of your thumb | Decreased strength when pinching or grasping objects | Decreased range of motion | Enlarged or bony appearance of the joint at the base of your thumb",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thumb-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20378339
Body dysmorphic disorder,"Body dysmorphic disorder is a mental health condition in which you can't stop thinking about one or more perceived defects or flaws in your appearance — a flaw that appears minor or can't be seen by others. But you may feel so embarrassed, ashamed and anxious that you may avoid many social situations.
When you have body dysmorphic disorder, you intensely focus on your appearance and body image, repeatedly checking the mirror, grooming or seeking reassurance, sometimes for many hours each day. Your perceived flaw and the repetitive behaviors cause you significant distress and impact your ability to function in your daily life.
You may seek out numerous cosmetic procedures to try to ""fix"" your perceived flaw. Afterward, you may feel temporary satisfaction or a reduction in your distress, but often the anxiety returns and you may resume searching for other ways to fix your perceived flaw.
Treatment of body dysmorphic disorder may include cognitive behavioral therapy and medication.","Signs and symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder include: | Being extremely preoccupied with a perceived flaw in appearance that to others can't be seen or appears minor | Strong belief that you have a defect in your appearance that makes you ugly or deformed | Belief that others take special notice of your appearance in a negative way or mock you | Engaging in behaviors aimed at fixing or hiding the perceived flaw that are difficult to resist or control, such as frequently checking the mirror, grooming or skin picking | Attempting to hide perceived flaws with styling, makeup or clothes | Constantly comparing your appearance with others | Frequently seeking reassurance about your appearance from others | Having perfectionist tendencies | Seeking cosmetic procedures with little satisfaction | Avoiding social situations | Preoccupation with your appearance and excessive thoughts and repetitive behaviors can be unwanted, difficult to control and so time-consuming that they can cause major distress or problems in your social life, work, school or other areas of functioning. | You may excessively focus over one or more parts of your body. The bodily feature that you focus on may change over time. The most common features people tend to fixate about include: | Face, such as nose, complexion, wrinkles, acne and other blemishes | Hair, such as appearance, thinning and baldness | Skin and vein appearance | Breast size | Muscle size and tone | Genitalia | A preoccupation with your body build being too small or not muscular enough (muscle dysmorphia) occurs almost exclusively in males. | Insight about body dysmorphic disorder varies. You may recognize that your beliefs about your perceived flaws may be excessive or not be true, or think that they probably are true, or be absolutely convinced that they're true.

Bedbugs,"Bedbugs are small, reddish-brown blood-sucking, wingless insects. Bedbug bites usually clear up without treatment in a week or two. Bedbugs aren't known to spread disease, but they can cause an allergic reaction or a severe skin reaction in some people.
Bedbugs are about the size of an apple seed. They hide in the cracks and crevices of beds, box springs, headboards, bed frames and other objects around a bed and come out at night to feed on their preferred host, humans. The risk of running into bedbugs is higher if you spend time in places where nighttime guests come and go often — such as hotels, hospitals or homeless shelters.
If you have bedbugs in your home, professional extermination is recommended.","Symptoms of bedbug bites are similar to symptoms of other insect bites and rashes. Bedbug bites are usually: | Inflamed spots, often with a darker spot in the middle | Itchy | Arranged in a rough line or in a cluster | Located on the face, neck, arms and hands | Some people have no reaction to bedbug bites, while others experience an allergic reaction that can include severe itching, blisters or hives.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bedbugs/symptoms-causes/syc-20370001
Bedsores (pressure ulcers),"Bedsores are injuries to the skin and the tissue below the skin that are due to pressure on the skin for a long time. Bedsores most often arise on skin that covers bony areas of the body, such as the heels, ankles, hips and tailbone. Bedsores also are called pressure ulcers, pressure injuries and decubitus ulcers.
The people who are most at risk of bedsores have medical conditions that keep them from changing positions or moving. Or they spend most of their time in a bed or a chair.
Bedsores can arise over hours or days. Most sores heal with treatment, but some never heal completely. You can take steps to put a stop to bedsores and help them heal.","Symptoms of bedsores are: | Changes in skin color or texture. | Swelling. | Pus-like draining. | An area of skin that feels cooler or warmer to the touch than other areas. | Sore areas. | Bedsores fall into one of several stages based on their depth, how serious they are and other features.

Bed-wetting,"Bed-wetting — also called nighttime incontinence or nocturnal enuresis — means passing urine without intending to while asleep. This happens after the age at which staying dry at night can be reasonably expected.
Soggy sheets and pajamas — and an embarrassed child — are a familiar scene in many homes. But don't get upset if your child wets the bed. Bed-wetting isn't a sign of problems with toilet training. It's often just a typical part of a child's development.
Generally, bed-wetting before age 7 isn't a concern. At this age, your child may still be developing nighttime bladder control.
If your child continues to wet the bed, treat the problem with patience and understanding. Lifestyle changes, bladder training, moisture alarms and sometimes medicine may help lessen bed-wetting.","Most kids are fully toilet trained by age 5, but there's really no target date for having complete bladder control. Between the ages of 5 and 7, bed-wetting remains a problem for some children.

Bee sting,"A bee sting is a common outdoor nuisance. You can take several steps to avoid stings from bees, hornets and wasps. If you're stung, basic first aid can help ease the pain of a mild or moderate reaction. You may need emergency medical help for a severe reaction.","Bee sting symptoms can range from pain and swelling to a life-threatening allergic reaction. Having one type of reaction doesn't mean you'll always have the same reaction every time you're stung or that the next reaction will be more severe. | Mild reaction.Most of the time, bee sting symptoms are minor and include instant, sharp burning pain, a welt and swelling. In most people, the swelling and pain go away within a few hours. | Moderate reaction.Some people who get stung by a bee or other insect have a stronger reaction, with burning pain, a welt, itching, flushing and swelling that gets worse over the next day or two. The symptoms can last up to seven days. | Severe reaction.A severe reaction to a bee sting is potentially life-threatening and requires emergency treatment. This type of reaction is called anaphylaxis. A small percentage of people who are stung by a bee or other insect develop anaphylaxis. It usually happens 15 minutes to an hour after the sting. Symptoms include rash, itching, trouble breathing, swollen tongue, trouble swallowing and tightness in the chest. | Multiple bee stings.If you get stung more than a dozen times, you can have a bad reaction that makes you feel quite sick.

Treatment involves medications to reduce the signs and symptoms of Behcet's disease and to prevent serious complications, such as blindness.","Behcet's disease symptoms vary from person to person, can come and go or become less severe over time. Signs and symptoms depend on which parts of your body are affected. | Areas commonly affected by Behcet's disease include: | Mouth.Painful mouth sores that look similar to canker sores are the most common sign of Behcet's disease. They begin as raised, round lesions in the mouth that quickly turn into painful ulcers. The sores usually heal in one to three weeks, though they do recur. | Skin.Some people develop acnelike sores on their bodies. Others develop red, raised and tender nodules on their skin, especially on the lower legs. | Genitals.Red, open sores can occur on the scrotum or the vulva. The sores are usually painful and can leave scars. | Eyes.Inflammation in the eye (uveitis) causes redness, pain and blurred vision, typically in both eyes. In people with Behcet's disease, the condition can come and go. | Joints.Joint swelling and pain often affect the knees in people with Behcet's disease. The ankles, elbows or wrists also might be involved. Signs and symptoms can last one to three weeks and go away on their own. | Blood vessels.Inflammation in veins and arteries can cause redness, pain, and swelling in the arms or legs when a blood clot results. Inflammation in the large arteries can lead to complications, such as aneurysms and narrowing or blockage of the vessel. | Digestive system.A variety of signs and symptoms can affect the digestive system, including abdominal pain, diarrhea and bleeding. | Brain.Inflammation in the brain and nervous system can cause headache, fever, disorientation, poor balance or stroke.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/behcets-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20351326
Bell's palsy,"Bell's palsy is a condition that causes sudden weakness in the muscles on one side of the face. Often the weakness is short-term and improves over weeks. The weakness makes half of the face appear to droop. Smiles are one-sided, and the eye on the affected side is hard to close.
Bell's palsy also is known as acute peripheral facial palsy of unknown cause. It can occur at any age. The exact cause is not known. Experts think it's caused by swelling and irritation of the nerve that controls the muscles on one side of the face. Bell's palsy could be caused by a reaction that occurs after a viral infection.
Symptoms usually start to improve within a few weeks, with complete recovery in about six months. A small number of people continue to have some Bell's palsy symptoms for life. Rarely, Bell's palsy occurs more than once.","Symptoms of Bell's palsy come on suddenly and may include: | Mild weakness to total paralysis on one side of the face — occurring within hours to days. | Facial droop and trouble making facial expressions, such as closing an eye or smiling. | Drooling. | Pain around the jaw or pain in or behind the ear on the affected side. | Increased sensitivity to sound on the affected side. | Headache. | Loss of taste. | Changes in the amount of tears and saliva produced. | Rarely, Bell's palsy can affect the nerves on both sides of the face.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bells-palsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20370028
Benign adrenal tumors,"Benign adrenal tumors are masses that aren't cancer. They form in the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are part of the endocrine system. These glands make hormones that send messages to nearly every organ and tissue in the body.
There are two adrenal glands, one above each kidney. Each gland has two types of tissue: the cortex and the medulla. Benign adrenal tumors that grow in the cortex are called adrenal adenomas. Those that grow in the medulla are called pheochromocytomas (fee-o-kroe-moe-sy-TOE-muhs).
Most benign adrenal tumors cause no symptoms and don't need treatment. But sometimes these tumors make high levels of some hormones that can cause problems. Hormones from the cortex control metabolism, blood pressure and certain body features, such as hair growth. Hormones from the medulla control the body's response to stress.","Symptoms depend on whether the tumor makes hormones, what hormone it makes and how much it makes. But many benign adrenal gland tumors don't cause symptoms because they don't make hormones. | The most common type of benign adrenal tumor, called adenoma, comes from the adrenal cortex. This type of tumor might cause symptoms such as: | Weight gain. | Easy bruising. | High blood pressure, also called hypertension. | Diabetes. | Depressed mood. | Tiredness. | Muscle weakness or cramping. | A type of benign adrenal tumor from the medulla is called pheochromocytoma. It might cause the following symptoms: | High blood pressure, also called hypertension. | Fast heartbeat. | Sweating. | Tremors. | Headache.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/benign-adrenal-tumors/symptoms-causes/syc-20356190
Geographic tongue,"Geographic tongue is an inflammatory but harmless condition affecting the surface of the tongue. The tongue usually is covered with tiny, pinkish-white bumps called papillae. These papillae are actually fine, hairlike structures. With geographic tongue, patches on the surface of the tongue are missing papillae. These patches are smooth and red, often with slightly raised borders.
This condition is called geographic tongue because the patches make your tongue look like a map. The patches often appear in one area and then move to a different part of the tongue.
Although geographic tongue may look alarming, it does not cause health issues. It's not related to infection or cancer. Geographic tongue sometimes can cause tongue pain and make you more sensitive to certain foods, such as spices, salt and even sweets.","Symptoms of geographic tongue may include: | Smooth, red, irregularly shaped patches on the top or side of your tongue. These patches may look like sores. | Frequent changes in the location, size and shape of the patches. | Pain or burning feeling in some cases, most often related to eating spicy or acidic foods. | Many people with geographic tongue have no symptoms. | Geographic tongue can continue for days, months or years. The problem often goes away on its own, but it may appear again later.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/geographic-tongue/symptoms-causes/syc-20354396
Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV),"Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is one of the most common causes of vertigo — the sudden sensation that you're spinning or that the inside of your head is spinning.
BPPVcauses brief episodes of mild to intense dizziness. It is usually triggered by specific changes in your head's position. This might occur when you tip your head up or down, when you lie down, or when you turn over or sit up in bed.
AlthoughBPPVcan be bothersome, it's rarely serious except when it increases the chance of falls. You can receive effective treatment forBPPVduring a doctor's office visit.","The signs and symptoms of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) may include: | Dizziness | A sense that you or your surroundings are spinning or moving (vertigo) | A loss of balance or unsteadiness | Nausea | Vomiting | The signs and symptoms ofBPPVcan come and go and commonly last less than one minute. Episodes ofBPPVcan disappear for some time and then recur. | Activities that bring about the signs and symptoms ofBPPVcan vary from person to person, but are almost always brought on by a change in head position. Some people also feel out of balance when standing or walking. | Abnormal rhythmic eye movements usually accompany the symptoms of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vertigo/symptoms-causes/syc-20370055
Benign peripheral nerve tumor,"Benign peripheral nerve tumors are tumors that form on peripheral nerves. The peripheral nerves link the brain and spinal cord to other parts of the body. These nerves control muscles that allow you to walk, blink, swallow, pick things up and do other activities. Benign tumors are not cancerous.
Several different types of tumors may form on the peripheral nerves. While some are caused by genetics, the cause of these tumors is usually not known.
Although most of these types of tumors are not cancerous, they can cause nerve damage and loss of muscle control. It's important to see your healthcare professional if you have a lump or if you have pain, tingling, numbness or muscle weakness.","Symptoms depend on the location of the benign peripheral nerve tumor and the nerves and tissues it affects. Symptoms may include: | Swelling or a lump under your skin. | Pain, tingling or numbness. | Weakness or loss of function in the affected area. | Dizziness or loss of balance. | A benign peripheral nerve tumor can cause symptoms if it presses on the nerve in which it is growing. It also can press on nearby nerves, blood vessels or tissues. | As a tumor grows, it may be more likely to cause symptoms. But even small tumors can cause symptoms.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peripheral-nerve-tumors-benign/symptoms-causes/syc-20368680
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH),"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a health issue that becomes more common with age. It's also called an enlarged prostate. The prostate is a small gland that helps make semen. It's found just below the bladder. And it often gets bigger as you get older.
An enlarged prostate can cause symptoms that may bother you, such as blocking the flow of urine out of the bladder. It also can cause bladder, urinary tract or kidney problems.
Many treatments can helpBPH. These include medicines, surgery and other procedures. Your health care provider can help you choose. The right option depends on things such as:","Common symptoms ofBPHinclude: | Frequent or urgent need to pee, also called urination. | Peeing more often at night. | Trouble starting to pee. | Weak urine stream, or a stream that stops and starts. | Dribbling at the end of urination. | Not being able to fully empty the bladder. | Less common symptoms include: | Urinary tract infection. | Not being able to pee. | Blood in the urine. | The symptoms ofBPHtend to slowly get worse. But sometimes they stay the same or even improve over time. | The size of the prostate doesn't always determine how serious the symptoms are. Some people with slightly enlarged prostates can have major symptoms. Others who have very enlarged prostates can have minor problems. And some people with enlarged prostates don't have any symptoms at all.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/symptoms-causes/syc-20370087
IgA nephropathy (Berger disease),"IgAnephropathy (nuh-FROP-uh-thee), also known as Berger disease, is a kidney disease. It happens when a germ-fighting protein called immunoglobulin A (IgA) builds up in the kidneys. This causes a type of swelling called inflammation that, over time, can make it harder for the kidneys to filter waste from the blood.
IgAnephropathy often becomes worse slowly over years. But the course of the disease varies from person to person. Some people leak blood into their urine without having other problems. Others might have complications such as losing kidney function and spilling protein into the urine. Still others develop kidney failure, which means the kidneys stop working well enough to filter the body's waste on their own.
There's no cure forIgAnephropathy, but medicines can slow how quickly it becomes worse. Some people need treatment to lower inflammation, reduce the spilling of protein into the urine and prevent the kidneys from failing. Such treatments may help the disease become not active, a state called remission. Keeping blood pressure under control and lowering cholesterol also slow the disease.","IgAnephropathy often doesn't cause symptoms early on. You might not notice any health effects for 10 years or more. Sometimes, routine medical tests find signs of the disease, such as protein and red blood cells in the urine that are seen under a microscope. | WhenIgAnephropathy causes symptoms, they might include: | Cola- or tea-colored urine caused by blood. You might notice these color changes after a cold, sore throat or respiratory infection. | Blood that can be seen in the urine. | Foamy urine from protein leaking into the urine. This is called proteinuria. | Pain on one or both sides of the back below the ribs. | Swelling in the hands and feet called edema. | High blood pressure. | Weakness and tiredness. | If the disease leads to kidney failure, symptoms may include: | Rashes and itchy skin. | Muscle cramps. | Upset stomach and vomiting. | Less appetite. | Metallic taste in the mouth. | Confusion. | Kidney failure is life-threatening without treatment. But dialysis or a kidney transplant can help people live for many more years.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/iga-nephropathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20352268
Cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer),"Cholangiocarcinoma is a type of cancer that forms in the slender tubes (bile ducts) that carry the digestive fluid bile. Bile ducts connect your liver to your gallbladder and to your small intestine.
Cholangiocarcinoma, also known as bile duct cancer, occurs mostly in people older than age 50, though it can occur at any age.
Doctors divide cholangiocarcinoma into different types based on where the cancer occurs in the bile ducts:
Cholangiocarcinoma is often diagnosed when it's advanced, making successful treatment difficult to achieve.","Signs and symptoms of cholangiocarcinoma include: | Yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice) | Intensely itchy skin | White-colored stools | Fatigue | Abdominal pain on the right side, just below the ribs | Losing weight without trying | Fever | Night sweats | Dark urine",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cholangiocarcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352408

Alcohol poisoning,"Alcohol poisoning is a serious — and sometimes deadly — result of drinking large amounts of alcohol in a short period of time. Drinking too much too quickly can affect breathing, heart rate, body temperature and gag reflex. In some cases, this can lead to a coma and death.
Alcohol poisoning also can occur when adults or children accidentally or intentionally drink household products that contain alcohol.
If you think that someone has alcohol poisoning, get medical attention right away.","Alcohol poisoning symptoms include: | Confusion. | Vomiting. | Seizures. | Slow breathing, which is fewer than eight breaths a minute. | Breathing that's not regular. This is when there is a gap of more than 10 seconds between breaths. | Skin that looks blue, gray or pale. | Low body temperature, also known as hypothermia. | Trouble staying conscious or awake.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcohol-poisoning/symptoms-causes/syc-20354386
Binge-eating disorder,"Binge-eating disorder is a serious condition. It always involves feeling like you're not able to stop eating. It also often involves eating much larger than usual amounts of food.
Almost everyone overeats on occasion, such as having seconds or thirds of a holiday meal. But regularly feeling that eating is out of control and eating an unusually large amount of food may be symptoms of binge-eating disorder.
People who have binge-eating disorder often feel embarrassed or ashamed about eating binges. People with the disorder often go through periods of trying to restrict or severely cut back on their eating as a result. But this instead may increase urges to eat and lead to a cycle of ongoing binge eating. Treatment for binge-eating disorder can help people feel more in control and balanced with their eating.","If you have binge-eating disorder, you may be overweight or obese, or you may be at a healthy weight. Most people with binge-eating disorder feel upset about their body size or shape no matter what the number on the scale is. | Symptoms of binge-eating disorder vary but can include: | Feeling that you don't have control over your eating behavior, for example, you can't stop once you start. | Often eating much larger than usual amounts of food in a specific amount of time, such as over a two-hour period. | Eating even when you're full or not hungry. | Eating very fast during eating binges. | Eating until you're uncomfortably full. | Often eating alone or in secret. | Feeling depressed, disgusted, ashamed, guilty or upset about your eating. | A person with bulimia nervosa, another eating disorder, may binge and then vomit, use laxatives or exercise excessively to get rid of extra calories. This is not the case with binge-eating disorder. If you have binge-eating disorder, you may try to diet or eat less food at mealtimes to compensate. But restricting your diet may simply lead to more binge eating. | How much eating binges affect your mood and ability to function in daily life gives an idea of how serious the condition is for you. Binge-eating disorder can vary over time. The condition may be short-lived, may go away and come back, or may continue for years if left untreated.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/binge-eating-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20353627
Bipolar disorder,"Bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings. These include emotional highs, also known as mania or hypomania, and lows, also known as depression. Hypomania is less extreme than mania.
When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. When your mood shifts to mania or hypomania, you may feel very excited and happy (euphoric), full of energy or unusually irritable. These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to think clearly.
Episodes of mood swings from depression to mania may occur rarely or multiple times a year. Each bout usually lasts several days. Between episodes, some people have long periods of emotional stability. Others may frequently have mood swings from depression to mania or both depression and mania at the same time.
Although bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, you can manage your mood swings and other symptoms by following a treatment plan. In most cases, healthcare professionals use medicines and talk therapy, also known as psychotherapy, to treat bipolar disorder.","There are several types of bipolar and related disorders: | Bipolar I disorder.You've had at least one manic episode that may come before or after hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In some cases, mania may cause a break from reality. This is called psychosis. | Bipolar II disorder.You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode. But you've never had a manic episode. | Cyclothymia.You've had at least two years — or one year in children and teenagers — of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms. These symptoms are less severe than major depression. | Other types.These types include bipolar and related disorders caused by certain drugs or alcohol, or due to a medical condition, such as Cushing's disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke. | These types may include mania, or hypomania, which is less extreme than mania, and depression. Symptoms can cause changes in mood and behavior that can't be predicted. This can lead to a lot of distress and cause you to have a hard time in life. | Bipolar II disorder is not a milder form of bipolar I disorder. It's a separate diagnosis. While the manic episodes of bipolar I disorder can be severe and dangerous, people with bipolar II disorder can be depressed for longer periods of time. | Bipolar disorder can start at any age, but usually it's diagnosed in the teenage years or early 20s. Symptoms can differ from person to person, and symptoms may vary over time.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bipolar-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20355955
Bird flu (avian influenza),"Bird flu, also called avian influenza, is caused by influenza type A virus infections in bird species. Depending on the strain, bird flu may cause the bird to have no symptoms, mild illness, serious illness or lead to the death of the bird.
Bird flu rarely infects humans. But health officials worry because influenza A viruses that infect birds can change, called mutate, to infect humans and spread from person to person more often. Because a new strain of bird flu would be a new virus to humans, a mutated strain like that could spread quickly around the world.
People most often catch a bird flu virus from close, long-term contact with live, domesticated poultry typically on farms or in backyard coops. People also may catch bird flu through contact with wild birds or another type of animal. Bird flu rarely has spread from person to person.
In humans, flu is a viral infection of the nose, throat and lungs, which are part of the respiratory system. Symptoms of bird flu in humans are similar to flu symptoms and may be mild to serious.","Bird flu symptoms can be mild to serious in a person. Symptoms typically show up within seven days of contact with the virus but can take as long as two weeks. A person can get infected from direct contact with an infected animal, or the bedding or stool of the animal. | Flu viruses have similar symptoms. So you need to be tested to check if you have a bird flu infection. | Common bird flu symptoms include: | Fever. | Problems breathing. | Pink eye, also called conjunctivitis. | Upset stomach and vomiting. | Loose stool, called diarrhea. | Bird flu may cause breathing problems more often than other kinds of flu. And during bird flu pandemics, the risk that a person with flu will need a machine to help them breathe is higher.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bird-flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20568390
Black hairy tongue,"Black hairy tongue is a condition of the tongue that gives it a dark, furry look. The look usually results from a buildup of dead skin cells on the many tiny, rounded bumps on the surface of the tongue. These bumps, called papillae, contain taste buds. When these bumps become longer than usual, they can easily trap and be stained by tobacco, food, drinks, bacteria or yeast, or other substances.
Black hairy tongue may look alarming, but it's usually painless and doesn't cause any health problems. The condition usually goes away by dealing with the causes and by regular mouth and tongue cleaning.","Symptoms of black hairy tongue include: | Black color of the tongue, but the color may be brown, green, yellow or white. | A hairy or furry look to the tongue. | Changed taste or a metallic taste in your mouth. | Bad breath. | Gagging or tickling feeling in your mouth, if the papillae are very large. | Rarely, a burning feeling on the tongue if hairy black tongue is caused by a yeast or bacterial infection.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/black-hairy-tongue/symptoms-causes/syc-20356077
Acne,"Acne is a skin condition that occurs when your hair follicles become plugged with oil and dead skin cells. It causes whiteheads, blackheads or pimples. Acne is most common among teenagers, though it affects people of all ages.
Effective acne treatments are available, but acne can be persistent. The pimples and bumps heal slowly, and when one begins to go away, others seem to crop up.
Depending on its severity, acne can cause emotional distress and scar the skin. The earlier you start treatment, the lower your risk of such problems.","Acne signs vary depending on the severity of your condition: | Whiteheads (closed plugged pores) | Blackheads (open plugged pores) | Small red, tender bumps (papules) | Pimples (pustules), which are papules with pus at their tips | Large, solid, painful lumps under the skin (nodules) | Painful, pus-filled lumps under the skin (cystic lesions) | Acne usually appears on the face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acne/symptoms-causes/syc-20368047
Bladder stones,,,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bladder-stones/symptoms-causes/syc-20354339
Bladder cancer,"Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that begins in the cells of the bladder. The bladder is a hollow muscular organ in your lower abdomen that stores urine.
Bladder cancer most often begins in the cells (urothelial cells) that line the inside of your bladder. Urothelial cells are also found in your kidneys and the tubes (ureters) that connect the kidneys to the bladder. Urothelial cancer can happen in the kidneys and ureters, too, but it's much more common in the bladder.
Most bladder cancers are diagnosed at an early stage, when the cancer is highly treatable. But even early-stage bladder cancers can come back after successful treatment. For this reason, people with bladder cancer typically need follow-up tests for years after treatment to look for bladder cancer that recurs.","Bladder cancer signs and symptoms may include: | Blood in urine (hematuria), which may cause urine to appear bright red or cola colored, though sometimes the urine appears normal and blood is detected on a lab test | Frequent urination | Painful urination | Back pain",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bladder-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20356104
Urinary incontinence,"Urinary incontinence — the loss of bladder control — is a common and often embarrassing problem. The severity ranges from occasionally leaking urine when you cough or sneeze to having an urge to urinate that's so sudden and strong you don't get to a toilet in time.
Though it occurs more often as people get older, urinary incontinence isn't an inevitable consequence of aging. If urinary incontinence affects your daily activities, don't hesitate to see your doctor. For most people, simple lifestyle and dietary changes or medical care can treat symptoms of urinary incontinence.","Many people experience occasional, minor leaks of urine. Others may lose small to moderate amounts of urine more frequently. | Types of urinary incontinence include: | Stress incontinence.Urine leaks when you exert pressure on your bladder by coughing, sneezing, laughing, exercising or lifting something heavy. | Urge incontinence.You have a sudden, intense urge to urinate followed by an involuntary loss of urine. You may need to urinate often, including throughout the night. Urge incontinence may be caused by a minor condition, such as infection, or a more severe condition such as a neurological disorder or diabetes. | Overflow incontinence.You experience frequent or constant dribbling of urine due to a bladder that doesn't empty completely. | Functional incontinence.A physical or mental impairment keeps you from making it to the toilet in time. For example, if you have severe arthritis, you may not be able to unbutton your pants quickly enough. | Mixed incontinence.You experience more than one type of urinary incontinence — most often this refers to a combination of stress incontinence and urge incontinence.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-incontinence/symptoms-causes/syc-20352808
Bladder exstrophy,"Bladder exstrophy (EK-stroh-fee) is a rare condition present at birth. During pregnancy, the bladder of an unborn baby, also called a fetus, forms outside of the stomach area. This area also is called the abdomen. The exposed bladder can't store urine or work as it should. This causes the baby to leak urine after being born.
Bladder exstrophy also can affect the genitals, stomach muscles, pelvic bones, intestines and reproductive organs. The cause of the condition isn't clear, but genes may play a role.
Bladder exstrophy may be spotted on a routine ultrasound during pregnancy. But sometimes, the condition can't be seen until the baby is born. A baby born with bladder exstrophy needs surgery to close the bladder and repair other affected body parts as needed.","Bladder exstrophy can involve a spectrum of symptoms. The symptoms depend on which body parts are affected along with the bladder and stomach area, and how serious the effects are. Bladder exstrophy is the most common in a larger group of conditions present at birth called the bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex (BEEC). Children with BEEC have one of the following: | Epispadias.This is the least serious form of BEEC. With an epispadias (ep-ih-SPAY-dee-us), the tube through which urine leaves the body doesn't fully develop. This tube is called the urethra. | Bladder exstrophy.This condition causes the bladder to form on the outside of the body. The bladder also is turned inside out. Usually, bladder exstrophy involves organs of the urinary tract, as well as the digestive and reproductive systems. Changes in the abdominal wall, bladder, genitals and pelvic bones can happen. So can changes in the end part of the large intestine called the rectum and the opening at the end of the rectum called the anus.Children with bladder exstrophy also have a condition that causes urine to flow the wrong way. This is called vesicoureteral reflux. Urine flows backward from the bladder into tubes called ureters that connect to the kidneys. Children with bladder exstrophy have epispadias as well. | Cloacal exstrophy.Cloacal exstrophy (kloe-AY-kul EK-stroh-fee) is the most serious form of BEEC. In this condition, the bladder and intestine are exposed. The anus may not open and the intestine may be short. The penis or the vagina may be split. The pelvic bones are affected as well.The kidneys, backbone and spinal cord also may be affected. Most children with cloacal exstrophy have spinal conditions, including spina bifida. Children born with protruding abdominal organs probably also have cloacal exstrophy or bladder exstrophy.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bladder-exstrophy/symptoms-causes/syc-20391299
Cystitis,"Cystitis (sis-TIE-tis) is the medical term for inflammation of the bladder. Inflammation is when a part of your body is swollen and hot. It can also be painful.
Most of the time, cystitis happens when there's an infection caused by bacteria. This is called a urinary tract infection (UTI). Having a bladder infection can be painful and annoying. It can become a serious health problem if the infection spreads to your kidneys.
Cystitis also may occur as a reaction to certain drugs or radiation therapy. Things that sometimes irritate the bladder, such as hygiene products, spermicide jelly or long-term catheter use, can also lead to cystitis. Cystitis can also happen as a complication of another illness.
The usual treatment for cystitis caused by bacteria is to take antibiotic medication. Treatment for other types of cystitis depends on the cause.","Cystitis signs and symptoms may include: | A strong, persistent urge to urinate | Pain or a burning feeling when urinating | Passing frequent, small amounts of urine | Blood in the urine (hematuria) | Passing cloudy or strong-smelling urine | Pelvic discomfort | A feeling of pressure in the area below your belly button (abdomen) | Low-grade fever | In young children, new episodes of accidental daytime wetting also may be a sign of a urinary tract infection (UTI).

Anterior vaginal prolapse (cystocele),"Anterior vaginal prolapse, also known as a cystocele (SIS-toe-seel) or a prolapsed bladder, is when the bladder drops from its usual position in the pelvis and pushes on the wall of the vagina.
The organs of the pelvis — including the bladder, uterus and intestines — are typically held in place by the muscles and connective tissues of the pelvic floor. Anterior prolapse occurs when the pelvic floor becomes weak or if too much pressure is put on the pelvic floor. This can happen over time, during vaginal childbirth or with chronic constipation, violent coughing or heavy lifting.
Anterior prolapse is treatable. For a mild or moderate prolapse, nonsurgical treatment is often effective. In more severe cases, surgery may be necessary to keep the vagina and other pelvic organs in their proper positions.","In mild cases of anterior prolapse, you may not notice any signs or symptoms. When signs and symptoms occur, they may include: | A feeling of fullness or pressure in your pelvis and vagina | In some cases, a bulge of tissue in your vagina that you can see or feel | Increased pelvic pressure when you strain, cough, bear down or lift | Problems urinating, including difficulty starting a urine stream, the feeling that you haven't completely emptied your bladder after urinating, feeling a frequent need to urinate or leaking urine (urinary incontinence) | Signs and symptoms often are especially noticeable after standing for long periods of time and may go away when you lie down.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cystocele/symptoms-causes/syc-20369452

Ureteral obstruction,"A ureteral obstruction is a blockage in one or both of the tubes (ureters) that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder. Ureteral obstruction can be cured. However, if it's not treated, symptoms can quickly move from mild — pain, fever and infection — to severe — loss of kidney function, sepsis and death.
Ureteral obstruction is fairly common. Because it's treatable, severe complications are rare.","Ureteral obstruction might have no signs or symptoms. Signs and symptoms depend on where the obstruction occurs, whether it's partial or complete, how quickly it develops, and whether it affects one or both kidneys. | Signs and symptoms might include: | Pain. | Changes in how much urine you produce (urine output). | Difficulty urinating. | Blood in the urine. | Urinary tract infections. | High blood pressure (hypertension).",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ureteral-obstruction/symptoms-causes/syc-20354676
Blood in urine (hematuria),"It can be scary to see blood in urine, also called hematuria. In many cases, the cause is harmless. But blood in urine also can be a sign of a serious illness.
If you can see the blood, it's called gross hematuria. Blood that can't be seen with the naked eye is called microscopic hematuria. It's such a small amount that it can be seen only under a microscope when a lab tests the urine. Either way, it's important to figure out the reason for the bleeding.
Treatment depends on the cause.","Blood in the urine can look pink, red or cola-colored. Red blood cells cause the urine to change color. It takes only a small amount of blood to turn urine red. | The bleeding often isn't painful. But if blood clots get passed in the urine, that can hurt.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/blood-in-urine/symptoms-causes/syc-20353432
Burning mouth syndrome,"Burning mouth syndrome is the medical term for ongoing or recurring burning in the mouth without an obvious cause. You may feel this burning on your tongue, gums, lips, inside of your cheeks, roof of your mouth or large areas of your whole mouth. The feeling of burning can be severe, as if you injured your mouth with a very hot drink.
Burning mouth syndrome usually comes on suddenly, but it can develop slowly over time. Often the specific cause can't be found. Although that makes treatment more challenging, working closely with your health care team can help you reduce symptoms.","Symptoms of burning mouth syndrome may include: | A burning or scalding feeling that most commonly affects your tongue, but also may affect your lips, gums, roof of your mouth, throat or whole mouth. | A feeling of dry mouth with increased thirst. | Taste changes in your mouth, such as a bitter or metallic taste. | Loss of taste. | Tingling, stinging or numbness in your mouth. | The discomfort from burning mouth syndrome can have several different patterns. It may: | Happen every day, with little discomfort when waking up, but become worse as the day goes on. | Start as soon as you wake up and last all day. | Come and go. | Whatever pattern of mouth discomfort you have, burning mouth syndrome may last for months to years. In rare cases, symptoms may suddenly go away on their own or happen less often. Sometimes the burning feeling may be briefly relieved during eating or drinking. | Burning mouth syndrome usually doesn't cause any physical changes to your tongue or mouth that can be seen.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/burning-mouth-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20350911

The term ""bone cancer"" doesn't include cancer that starts in another part of the body and spreads to the bones. Instead, cancer that spreads to the bone is named for the place it began. For example, cancer that starts in the lungs and spreads to the bones is still lung cancer. Healthcare professionals might call it lung cancer that has metastasized to the bones.
Cancer that starts in the bones is rare. Different types of bone cancers exist. Some types of bone cancers mostly happen in children. Other types happen mostly in adults.
Common bone cancer treatments include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. The best treatment for your bone cancer depends on the type of bone cancer, which bone is affected and other factors.","Signs and symptoms of bone cancer include: | Bone pain. | Swelling and tenderness near the affected area. | Weakened bone, which can lead to a broken bone. | Feeling very tired. | Losing weight without trying.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bone-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20350217
Osteomyelitis,"Osteomyelitis is an infection in a bone. It can affect one or more parts of a bone. Infections can reach a bone through the bloodstream or from nearby infected tissue. Infections also can begin in the bone if an injury opens the bone to germs.
People who smoke and people with chronic health conditions, such as diabetes or kidney failure, are at higher risk of getting osteomyelitis. People who have diabetes with foot ulcers may get osteomyelitis in the bones of their feet.
Most people with osteomyelitis need surgery to remove areas of the affected bone. After surgery, most often people need strong antibiotics given through a vein.","Symptoms of osteomyelitis may include: | Swelling, warmth and tenderness over the area of the infection. | Pain near the infection. | Tiredness. | Fever. | Sometimes osteomyelitis causes no symptoms. When it does cause symptoms, they can be like symptoms of other conditions. This may be especially true for infants, older adults and people who have weakened immune systems.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteomyelitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20375913

Bone spurs,"Bone spurs are bony growths that form along bone edges. They're also called osteophytes. Bone spurs often form where bones meet each other — in the joints. They also can form on the bones of the spine.
The main cause of bone spurs is the joint damage linked with the most common type of arthritis. This is called osteoarthritis. Bone spurs often cause no symptoms. You might not notice them, and your healthcare team might not happen to find them for years. Bone spurs might not need treatment. If treatment is needed, it depends on where spurs are located and how they affect your health.","Often, bone spurs don't cause symptoms. You might not know you have bone spurs until an X-ray for another condition reveals the growths. But sometimes, bone spurs can cause pain and loss of motion in your joints. | The symptoms depend on where the bone spurs are. Examples include: | Knee.Bone spurs in the knee can make it painful to extend and bend the leg. | Spine.On the small bones that form the spine, bone spurs can narrow the space that contains the spinal cord. These bone spurs can pinch the spinal cord or its nerve roots. That can cause weakness or numbness in the arms or legs. | Hip.Bone spurs can make it painful to move the hip. Sometimes, it might feel like the pain is in the knee or the thigh. Depending on their placement, bone spurs can reduce the range of motion in the hip joint.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bone-spurs/symptoms-causes/syc-20370212
Borderline personality disorder,"Borderline personality disorder is a mental health condition that affects the way people feel about themselves and others, making it hard to function in everyday life. It includes a pattern of unstable, intense relationships, as well as impulsiveness and an unhealthy way of seeing themselves. Impulsiveness involves having extreme emotions and acting or doing things without thinking about them first.
People with borderline personality disorder have a strong fear of abandonment or being left alone. Even though they want to have loving and lasting relationships, the fear of being abandoned often leads to mood swings and anger. It also leads to impulsiveness and self-injury that may push others away.
Borderline personality disorder usually begins by early adulthood. The condition is most serious in young adulthood. Mood swings, anger and impulsiveness often get better with age. But the main issues of self-image and fear of being abandoned, as well as relationship issues, go on.
If you have borderline personality disorder, know that many people with this condition get better with treatment. They can learn to live stabler, more-fulfilling lives.","Borderline personality disorder affects how you feel about yourself, relate to others and behave. | Symptoms may include: | A strong fear of abandonment. This includes going to extreme measures so you're not separated or rejected, even if these fears are made up. | A pattern of unstable, intense relationships, such as believing someone is perfect one moment and then suddenly believing the person doesn't care enough or is cruel. | Quick changes in how you see yourself. This includes shifting goals and values, as well as seeing yourself as bad or as if you don't exist. | Periods of stress-related paranoia and loss of contact with reality. These periods can last from a few minutes to a few hours. | Impulsive and risky behavior, such as gambling, dangerous driving, unsafe sex, spending sprees, binge eating, drug misuse, or sabotaging success by suddenly quitting a good job or ending a positive relationship. | Threats of suicide or self-injury, often in response to fears of separation or rejection. | Wide mood swings that last from a few hours to a few days. These mood swings can include periods of being very happy, irritable or anxious, or feeling shame. | Ongoing feelings of emptiness. | Inappropriate, strong anger, such as losing your temper often, being sarcastic or bitter, or physically fighting.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/borderline-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20370237
Botulism,"Botulism is a rare but serious condition caused by a toxin that attacks the body's nerves. Botulism may cause life-threatening symptoms. A type of bacteria called Clostridium botulinum produces the toxin. Botulism can occur as the result of food or wound contamination. The condition can also occur when bacterial spores grow in the intestines of infants. In rare cases, botulism can also be caused by medical treatment or bioterrorism.
Three common forms of botulism are:
Occasionally, botulism happens when too much botulinum toxin is injected for cosmetic or medical reasons. This rare form is called iatrogenic botulism. The term ""iatrogenic"" means an illness caused by medical exam or treatment.
Another rare form of botulism can occur from inhaling toxins. This may happen as the result of bioterrorism.
All forms of botulism can be fatal and are considered medical emergencies.",,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/botulism/symptoms-causes/syc-20370262
Fecal incontinence,"Fecal incontinence is accidental passing of solid or liquid stool. Fecal incontinence may happen when a person has a sudden urge to pass stool and cannot get to a toilet in time. Also, stool may leak when a person doesn't sense the need to pass stool.
Common causes of fecal incontinence include diarrhea, constipation, and muscle or nerve damage. Fecal incontinence can affect a person's ability to work, socialize or do typical daily activities. It often causes embarrassment or emotional stress.
Diagnosis and treatment are often avoided because the condition is difficult to discuss with a healthcare professional. Treatments can improve fecal incontinence and overall quality of life.
Fecal incontinence also may be called bowel incontinence or accidental bowel leakage.","The main symptom is not being able to control passing stool. This may happen during a short-term illness that causes diarrhea. For some people, fecal incontinence is an ongoing condition. | There are two types of fecal incontinence: | Urge incontinenceis the sudden urge to pass stool but not being able to control the urge. The need to pass stool may come on so suddenly that it's not possible to get to the toilet in time. | Passive incontinenceis passing stool when a person isn't aware of the need to pass stool. A person may not be able to feel that the rectum is full of stool. | Fecal incontinence also may be leakage of stool when a person passes gas.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fecal-incontinence/symptoms-causes/syc-20351397
Intestinal obstruction,,,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/intestinal-obstruction/symptoms-causes/syc-20351460
Brachial plexus injury,"The brachial plexus is the group of nerves that sends signals from the spinal cord to the shoulder, arm and hand. A brachial plexus injury happens when these nerves are stretched, squeezed together, or in the most serious cases, ripped apart or torn away from the spinal cord.
Minor brachial plexus injuries, called stingers or burners, are common in contact sports, such as football. Babies sometimes get brachial plexus injuries when they're born. Other health issues, such as inflammation or tumors, may affect the brachial plexus.
The most serious brachial plexus injuries happen during car or motorcycle accidents. Bad brachial plexus injuries can leave the arm paralyzed, but surgery may help.",Symptoms of a brachial plexus injury can differ depending on how serious the injury is and where it's located. Usually only one arm is affected.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brachial-plexus-injury/symptoms-causes/syc-20350235
Bradycardia,"Bradycardia (brad-e-KAHR-dee-uh) is a slow heart rate. The hearts of adults at rest usually beat between 60 and 100 times a minute. If you have bradycardia, your heart beats fewer than 60 times a minute.
Bradycardia can be a serious problem if the heart rate is very slow and the heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the body. If this happens, you may feel dizzy, very tired or weak, and short of breath. Sometimes bradycardia doesn't cause symptoms or complications.
A slow heart rate isn't always a concern. For example, a resting heart rate between 40 and 60 beats a minute is common in some people, particularly healthy young adults and trained athletes. It also is quite common during sleep.
If bradycardia is severe, a pacemaker may be needed to help the heart beat at an appropriate rate.","A slower than typical heartbeat is called bradycardia. If the slow heartbeat stops the brain and other organs from getting enough oxygen, symptoms may include: | Chest pain. | Confusion or memory problems. | Dizziness or lightheadedness. | Feeling very tired, especially during physical activity. | Fainting or near-fainting. | Shortness of breath.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bradycardia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355474

Brain aneurysm,"A brain aneurysm (AN-yoo-riz-um) — also known as a cerebral aneurysm or intracranial aneurysm — is a bulge or ballooning in a blood vessel in the brain. An aneurysm often looks like a berry hanging on a stem.
Experts think brain aneurysms form and grow because blood flowing through the blood vessel puts pressure on a weak area of the vessel wall. This can increase the size of the brain aneurysm. If the brain aneurysm leaks or ruptures, it causes bleeding in the brain, known as a hemorrhagic stroke.
Most often, a ruptured brain aneurysm occurs in the space between the brain and the thin tissues covering the brain. This type of hemorrhagic stroke is called a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Brain aneurysms are common. But most brain aneurysms aren't serious, especially if they're small. Most brain aneurysms don't rupture. They usually don't cause symptoms or cause health problems. In many cases, brain aneurysms are found during tests for other conditions.
However, a ruptured aneurysm quickly becomes life-threatening and requires medical treatment right away.
If a brain aneurysm hasn't ruptured, treatment may be appropriate in some cases. Treatment of an unruptured brain aneurysm may prevent a rupture in the future. Talk with your health care provider to make sure you understand the best options for your specific needs.","Most brain aneurysms that haven't ruptured don't cause symptoms. This is especially true if they're small. Brain aneurysms may be found during imaging tests that are done for other conditions. | However, a ruptured aneurysm is a very serious condition, typically causing a severe headache. And if an unruptured aneurysm presses against brain tissue or nerves, it may cause pain and other symptoms.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brain-aneurysm/symptoms-causes/syc-20361483
Brain AVM (arteriovenous malformation),"A brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a tangle of blood vessels that creates irregular connections between arteries and veins in the brain.
Arteries take oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the brain. Veins carry oxygen-depleted blood back to the lungs and heart. A brain AVM disrupts this vital process.
An arteriovenous malformation can develop anywhere in the body, but common locations include the brain and spinal cord. Overall, brain AVMs are rare.
The cause of brain AVMs isn't clear. Most people who have them are born with them, but they can form later in life. Rarely, AVM can be a trait passed down in families.
Some people with brain AVMs experience symptoms such as headaches or seizures. A brain AVM may be found after a brain scan for another health issue. Sometimes a brain AVM is found after the blood vessels burst and bleed, known as a hemorrhage.
Once diagnosed, a brain AVM can be treated to prevent complications such as brain damage or stroke.","A brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) may not cause any symptoms until the AVM bursts and bleeds, known as a hemorrhage. In about half of all brain AVMs, a hemorrhage is the first sign of the malformation. | But some people with brain AVMs may experience symptoms other than bleeding, such as: | Seizures. | Headaches or pain in one area of the head. | Muscle weakness or numbness in one part of the body. | Some people may experience more-serious symptoms depending on the location of the AVM, including: | A very bad headache. | Weakness, numbness or paralysis. | Vision loss. | Trouble speaking. | Confusion or not being able to understand others. | Trouble with walking. | Symptoms of a brain AVM may begin at any age but usually appear between ages 10 and 40. Brain AVMs can damage brain tissue over time. The effects slowly build and often cause symptoms in early adulthood. | By middle age, however, brain AVMs tend to remain stable and are less likely to cause symptoms.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brain-avm/symptoms-causes/syc-20350260
Brain metastases,"Brain metastases happen when cancer cells spread from their original site to the brain. Any cancer can spread to the brain. But the most common types that spread are lung, breast, colon, kidney and melanoma.
Brain metastases may form one or more tumors in the brain. As they grow, they put pressure on surrounding brain tissue. This can cause symptoms such as headache, personality changes, confusion, seizures, vision changes, trouble speaking, numbness, weakness or loss of balance.
Treatment for people whose cancer has spread to the brain may include surgery, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy or chemotherapy. Other treatments might be used to decrease pain and symptoms caused by the cancer.","Symptoms caused by brain metastases can vary. They depend on location, size and how fast they're growing. | Symptoms of brain metastases include: | Headache, sometimes with vomiting or nausea. | Mental changes, such as increasing memory problems. | Seizures. | Weakness or numbness on one side of the body. | Vision changes. | Difficulty speaking or understanding language. | Loss of balance.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brain-metastases/symptoms-causes/syc-20350136
Brain tumor,"A brain tumor is a growth of cells in the brain or near it. Brain tumors can happen in the brain tissue. Brain tumors also can happen near the brain tissue. Nearby locations include nerves, the pituitary gland, the pineal gland, and the membranes that cover the surface of the brain.
Brain tumors can begin in the brain. These are called primary brain tumors. Sometimes, cancer spreads to the brain from other parts of the body. These tumors are secondary brain tumors, also called metastatic brain tumors.
Many different types of primary brain tumors exist. Some brain tumors aren't cancerous. These are called noncancerous brain tumors or benign brain tumors. Noncancerous brain tumors may grow over time and press on the brain tissue. Other brain tumors are brain cancers, also called malignant brain tumors. Brain cancers may grow quickly. The cancer cells can invade and destroy the brain tissue.
Brain tumors range in size from very small to very large. Some brain tumors are found when they are very small because they cause symptoms that you notice right away. Other brain tumors grow very large before they're found. Some parts of the brain are less active than others. If a brain tumor starts in a part of the brain that's less active, it might not cause symptoms right away. The brain tumor size could become quite large before the tumor is detected.
Brain tumor treatment options depend on the type of brain tumor you have, as well as its size and location. Common treatments include surgery and radiation therapy.","The signs and symptoms of a brain tumor depend on the brain tumor's size and location. Symptoms also might depend on how fast the brain tumor is growing, which is also called the tumor grade. | General signs and symptoms caused by brain tumors may include: | Headache or pressure in the head that is worse in the morning. | Headaches that happen more often and seem more severe. | Headaches that are sometimes described as tension headaches or migraines. | Nausea or vomiting. | Eye problems, such as blurry vision, seeing double or losing sight on the sides of your vision. | Losing feeling or movement in an arm or a leg. | Trouble with balance. | Speech problems. | Feeling very tired. | Confusion in everyday matters. | Memory problems. | Having trouble following simple commands. | Personality or behavior changes. | Seizures, especially if there is no history of seizures. | Hearing problems. | Dizziness or a sense that the world is spinning, also called vertigo. | Feeling very hungry and gaining weight. | Brain tumors that aren't cancerous tend to cause symptoms that develop slowly. Noncancerous brain tumors also are called benign brain tumors. They might cause subtle symptoms that you don't notice at first. The symptoms might get worse over months or years. | Cancerous brain tumors cause symptoms that get worse quickly. Cancerous brain tumors also are called brain cancers or malignant brain tumors. They cause symptoms that come on suddenly. They get worse in a matter of days or weeks.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brain-tumor/symptoms-causes/syc-20350084
Pediatric brain tumors,"Pediatric brain tumors are growths of cells that start in or near the brain in children. The growths, called tumors, can grow to press on nearby parts of the brain. This can cause symptoms, such as headaches and nausea.
Many types of pediatric brain tumors exist. Some grow quickly, and some grow slowly. Some are cancerous, and some aren't cancerous. Noncancerous brain tumors also are called benign brain tumors.
The type of brain tumor a child has helps determine the best treatment plan. Other things your child's healthcare team considers include the tumor's location, whether it has spread beyond the brain, and your child's age and overall health.
Treatment for brain tumors in children is often quite different from treatment for adult brain tumors. For this reason, seek out care at a medical center that has experience caring for children with brain tumors.","Pediatric brain tumor symptoms may vary depending on the tumor's location within the brain. Symptoms also might depend on the size of the tumor and how quickly it's growing. | Some of the more common signs and symptoms of pediatric brain tumors include: | Headaches, which may become more frequent and more severe. In children who don't talk, a parent might notice that the child is more irritable than usual. | Nausea and vomiting. | Vision changes, such as double vision. In children who don't talk, a parent might notice that a child squints or covers one eye when trying to look at something. | Other possible signs and symptoms include: | A fuller soft spot on the skull in babies. | Changes in the way the eyes move. | Confusion and irritability. | Difficulty with balance. | Hearing problems. | Memory problems. | Personality or behavior changes. | Seizures, especially in a child who hasn't had a seizure before. | Slurred speech. | Trouble walking. | Trouble swallowing. | Weakness or drooping on one side on the face. | Weakness or loss of sensation in an arm or a leg.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pediatric-brain-tumor/symptoms-causes/syc-20361694
Inflammatory breast cancer,"Inflammatory breast cancer is a form of breast cancer that causes breast swelling and skin changes.
Inflammatory breast cancer happens when a growth of cells forms in the breast tissue. The cells break away from where they started to grow and travel to the lymphatic vessels in the skin. The cells can block the vessels and cause the skin on the breast to look swollen. This skin on the breast might look red or purple.
Inflammatory breast cancer is considered a locally advanced cancer. When a cancer is locally advanced, that means it has spread from where it started to nearby tissue and possibly to nearby lymph nodes.
Inflammatory breast cancer can easily be confused with a breast infection, which is a much more common cause of breast swelling and skin changes. Seek medical attention right away if you notice skin changes on your breast.","Inflammatory breast cancer doesn't commonly form a lump, as occurs with other forms of breast cancer. Instead, signs and symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer include: | Fast change in the appearance of one breast, over the course of several weeks. | Thickness, heaviness or swelling of one breast. | Changes in skin color, giving the breast a red, purple, pink or bruised appearance. | Unusual warmth of the affected breast. | Dimpling or ridges on the skin of the affected breast, similar to an orange peel. | Tenderness, pain or aching. | Enlarged lymph nodes under the arm, above the collarbone or below the collarbone. | Flattened nipple or nipple that turns inward on the affected breast. | For inflammatory breast cancer to be diagnosed, these symptoms must have been present for less than six months.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355413
Male breast cancer,"Male breast cancer is a rare cancer that begins as a growth of cells in the breast tissue of men.
Breast cancer is typically thought of as a condition that happens in women. But everyone is born with some breast tissue. So anyone can get breast cancer.
Male breast cancer is rare. It happens most often in older men, though it can occur at any age.
Treatment for male breast cancer typically involves surgery to remove the breast tissue. Other treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, may be recommended as well.","Signs and symptoms of male breast cancer can include: | A painless lump or thickening of the skin on the chest. | Changes to the skin covering the chest, such as dimpling, puckering, scaling or changes in the color of the skin. | Changes to the nipple, such as changes in the skin color or scaling, or a nipple that begins to turn inward. | Discharge or bleeding from the nipple.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/male-breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20374740
Breast cysts,"Breast cysts are fluid-filled sacs inside the breast. They are usually noncancerous (benign). You may have one or multiple breast cysts. A breast cyst often feels like a grape or a water-filled balloon, but sometimes a breast cyst feels firm.
Breast cysts don't require treatment unless a cyst is large and painful or uncomfortable. In that case, draining the fluid from a breast cyst can ease symptoms.
Although breast cysts can be found in women of any age, they're more common in women before menopause, typically under age 50. Breast cysts also commonly occur in postmenopausal women who take hormone therapy.","Breast cysts may be found in one or both breasts. Signs and symptoms of a breast cyst include: | A smooth, easily movable round or oval lump that may have smooth edges — which typically, though not always, indicates it's benign | Nipple discharge that may be clear, yellow, straw colored or dark brown | Breast pain or tenderness in the area of the breast lump | An increase in breast lump size and breast tenderness just before your period | A decrease in breast lump size and resolution of other symptoms after your period | Having breast cysts doesn't increase your risk of breast cancer. But having cysts may make it harder to find new breast lumps or other changes that might need evaluation by your doctor. Your breasts may feel lumpy and painful when you're menstruating, so it's important to be familiar with how your breasts feel throughout your menstrual cycle so that you'll know if something changes.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cysts/symptoms-causes/syc-20370284
Mastitis,"Mastitis is swelling and redness, called inflammation, of breast tissue. It sometimes involves an infection. Besides causing swelling and redness, mastitis causes breast pain and warmth. An infection also can cause fever and chills.
Mastitis most often affects people who are breastfeeding. This is called lactation mastitis. But mastitis can happen to people who aren't breastfeeding.
Lactation mastitis can cause you to feel run down, making it hard to care for your baby. Sometimes mastitis causes people to wean their babies earlier than they meant to. But continuing to breastfeed is better for you and your baby. This is true even if you're taking an antibiotic.","Symptoms of mastitis can appear suddenly. They may be in one or both breasts. Symptoms may include: | Breast tenderness or warmth. | Breast swelling. | Thickening of breast tissue, or a breast lump. | Pain or a burning feeling all the time or while breastfeeding. | Skin redness, often in a wedge-shaped pattern. The redness may be harder to see on Black or brown skin. | Feeling ill. | Fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 degrees Celsius) or greater.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mastitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20374829

Broken arm,"A broken arm involves one or more of the three bones in your arm — the ulna, radius and humerus. One of the most common causes of a broken arm is falling onto an outstretched hand. If you think you or your child has broken an arm, seek prompt medical attention. It's important to treat a fracture as soon as possible for proper healing.
Treatment depends on the site and severity of the injury. A simple break might be treated with a sling, ice and rest. However, the bone may require realignment (reduction) in the emergency room.
A more complicated break might require surgery to realign the broken bone and to implant wires, plates, nails or screws to keep the bone in place during healing.","A snap or cracking sound might be your first indication you've broken an arm. Signs and symptoms include: | Severe pain, which might increase with movement | Swelling | Bruising | Deformity, such as a bent arm or wrist | Inability to turn your arm from palm up to palm down or vice versa",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-arm/symptoms-causes/syc-20353260

Broken collarbone,"A broken collarbone is a common injury. The collarbone, also known as the clavicle, connects the shoulder blade to the breastbone. Common causes of a broken collarbone include falls, sports and traffic accidents. Infants sometimes break their collarbones while being born.
Seek medical help quickly for a broken collarbone. Most heal well with ice, pain relievers, a sling, physical therapy and time. Some breaks might require surgery to put plates, screws or rods into the bone to hold the pieces in place during healing.","Symptoms of a broken collarbone include: | Pain that increases when moving the shoulder. | Swelling, tenderness or bruising. | Skin over the break might look like a tent when gently pinched. | A bump on or near the shoulder. | A grinding or crackling sound when moving the shoulder. | Stiffness or not being able to move the shoulder. | Newborns often will not move their arm for days after breaking the collarbone during birth and will cry if someone moves the arm.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-collarbone/symptoms-causes/syc-20370311
Broken foot,"A broken foot, also called a fractured foot, is an injury to one or more bones in the foot. A bone might break from a sports injury, a car crash, a heavy object dropped on the foot, or a misstep or fall.
Fractures can range from tiny cracks in the bones to breaks in more than one bone and breaks that come through the skin.
Treatment for a broken foot bone depends on where the bone breaks and how bad the break is. A badly broken foot bone may need surgery to put plates, rods or screws into the broken bone pieces to hold them in place while they heal.","A broken foot bone might cause some of these symptoms: | Instant throbbing pain. | Pain that gets worse with activity and gets better with rest. | Swelling. | Bruising. | Tenderness. | Change in the typical shape of the foot, called deformity. | Trouble or pain with walking or putting weight on the foot. | Bone sticking through the skin, called an open fracture.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-foot/symptoms-causes/syc-20355492

Broken heart syndrome,"Broken heart syndrome is a heart condition that's often brought on by stressful situations and extreme emotions. The condition also can be triggered by a serious physical illness or surgery. Broken heart syndrome is usually temporary. But some people may continue to feel unwell after the heart is healed.
People with broken heart syndrome may have sudden chest pain or think they're having a heart attack. Broken heart syndrome affects just part of the heart. It briefly interrupts the way the heart pumps blood. The rest of the heart continues to work as usual. Sometimes the heart contracts more forcefully.
Medicines are used to treat symptoms of broken heart syndrome.
Broken heart syndrome also may be called:",Symptoms of broken heart syndrome can mimic those of a heart attack. Symptoms may include: | Chest pain. | Shortness of breath.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-heart-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20354617
Hip fracture,,,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hip-fracture/symptoms-causes/syc-20373468
Broken leg,"A broken leg (leg fracture) is a break or crack in one of the bones in your leg. Common causes include falls, motor vehicle accidents and sports injuries.
Treatment of a broken leg depends on the location and severity of the injury. A severely broken leg may require metal pins and plates to hold the fragments together. Less severe breaks may be treated with a cast or splint. In all cases, prompt diagnosis and treatment are critical to complete healing.","The thighbone (femur) is the strongest bone in the body. It is usually obvious when the thighbone is broken because it takes so much force to break. But a break in the shinbone (tibia) or in the bone that runs alongside the shinbone (fibula) may be less obvious. | Signs and symptoms of a broken leg may include: | Severe pain, which may worsen with movement | Swelling | Tenderness | Bruising | Obvious deformity or shortening of the affected leg | Inability to walk | Toddlers or young children who break a leg may start limping or simply stop walking, even if they can't explain why.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-leg/symptoms-causes/syc-20370412
Broken nose,,,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-nose/symptoms-causes/syc-20370439
Broken ribs,"A broken rib is a common injury that occurs when one of the bones in the rib cage breaks or cracks. The most common causes are hard impacts from falls, car accidents or contact sports.
Many broken ribs are simply cracked. Cracked ribs are painful. But they don't cause the problems that ribs that have broken into pieces can. The sharp edge of a broken bone can harm major blood vessels or lungs and other organs.
Usually, broken ribs heal on their own in about six weeks. Pain control is important for being able to breathe deeply and avoid lung issues, such as pneumonia.",The following can cause pain with a broken rib or make pain worse: | A deep breath. | Pressure on the injured area. | A bend or a twist of the body.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-ribs/symptoms-causes/syc-20350763
Broken toe,"A broken toe is a common injury that's most often caused by dropping something on a foot or stubbing a toe.
Usually, treating a broken toe involves taping it to the next toe. But if the fracture is severe — especially if it's in the big toe — proper healing might require a cast or even surgery to heal well.
Most broken toes heal well, usually within 4 to 6 weeks. Sometimes, however, a broken toe can get infected. Also, the break might increase the risk of getting osteoarthritis in that toe in the future.",Signs and symptoms of a broken toe include: | Pain | Swelling | Change in skin color from bruising or bleeding under the skin,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-toe/symptoms-causes/syc-20370463
Broken wrist,"A broken wrist is a break or crack in one or more of the bones of your wrist. The most common of these injuries occurs in the wrist when people try to catch themselves during a fall and land hard on an outstretched hand.
You may be at higher risk of a broken wrist if you participate in sports like in-line skating or snowboarding, or if you have a condition in which bones become thinner and more fragile (osteoporosis).
It's important to treat a broken wrist as soon as possible. Otherwise, the bones might not heal in proper alignment, which might affect your ability to do everyday activities, such as writing or buttoning a shirt. Early treatment will also help minimize pain and stiffness.","A broken wrist might cause these signs and symptoms: | Severe pain that might worsen when gripping or squeezing or moving your hand or wrist | Swelling | Tenderness | Bruising | Obvious deformity, such as a bent wrist",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-wrist/symptoms-causes/syc-20353169
Bronchiolitis,"Bronchiolitis is a common lung infection in young children and infants. It causes swelling and irritation and a buildup of mucus in the small airways of the lung. These small airways are called bronchioles. Bronchiolitis is almost always caused by a virus.
Bronchiolitis starts out with symptoms much like a common cold. But then it gets worse, causing coughing and a high-pitched whistling sound when breathing out called wheezing. Sometimes children have trouble breathing. Symptoms of bronchiolitis can last for 1 to 2 weeks but occasionally can last longer.
Most children get better with care at home. A small number of children need a stay in the hospital.","For the first few days, the symptoms of bronchiolitis are much like a cold: | Runny nose. | Stuffy nose. | Cough. | Sometimes a slight fever. | Later, your child may have a week or more of working harder than usual to breathe, which may include wheezing. | Many infants with bronchiolitis also have an ear infection called otitis media.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bronchiolitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351565
Bronchitis,"Bronchitis is an inflammation of the lining of your bronchial tubes. These tubes carry air to and from your lungs. People who have bronchitis often cough up thickened mucus, which can be discolored. Bronchitis may start suddenly and be short term (acute) or start gradually and become long term (chronic).
Acute bronchitis, which often develops from a cold or other respiratory infection, is very common. Also called a chest cold, acute bronchitis usually improves within a week to 10 days without lasting effects, although the cough may linger for weeks.
Chronic bronchitis, a more serious condition, is a constant irritation or inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes, often due to smoking. If you have repeated bouts of bronchitis, you may have chronic bronchitis, which requires medical attention. Chronic bronchitis is one of the conditions included in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).","If you have acute bronchitis, you may have cold symptoms, such as: |  | Cough | Production of mucus (sputum), which can be clear, white, yellowish-gray or green in color — rarely, it may be streaked with blood | Sore throat | Mild headache and body aches | Slight fever and chills | Fatigue | Chest discomfort | Shortness of breath and wheezing | While these symptoms usually improve in about a week, you may have a nagging cough that lingers for several weeks. | For chronic bronchitis, signs and symptoms may include: | Cough | Production of mucus | Fatigue | Chest discomfort | Shortness of breath | Chronic bronchitis is typically defined as a productive cough that lasts at least three months, with bouts that recur for at least two consecutive years. If you have chronic bronchitis, you're likely to have periods when your cough or other symptoms worsen. It's also possible to have an acute infection on top of chronic bronchitis.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bronchitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355566

Buerger disease,"Buerger disease is a rare disease of the arteries and veins in the arms and legs. In Buerger disease — also called thromboangiitis obliterans — blood vessels become blocked. This reduces blood flow to the affected areas. Blood clots may form in the blood vessels.
Over time, the lack of blood flow damages or destroys skin tissue. The damage can lead to infection and death of body tissue, called gangrene. Buerger disease is usually first seen in the feet. It may eventually affect the blood vessels of the hand. Blood clots may form in the small veins of the arms and legs.
People who get Buerger disease almost always smoke cigarettes or use other forms of tobacco, such as chewing tobacco. Quitting all forms of tobacco is the only way to stop Buerger disease. For those who don't quit, surgery to remove fingers and toes might be needed.","Buerger disease symptoms include: | Tingling or numbness in the fingers or toes. | Changes in skin color in the hands and feet. The skin may look pale gray, red or blue. Depending on your skin color, these color changes may be harder or easier to see. | Fingers and toes that turn white then blue when exposed to cold, known as Raynaud's disease. Depending on your skin color, these color changes may be harder or easier to see. | Pain in the feet that occurs with walking. The pain may make it difficult to walk long distances. | Painful open sores on fingers and toes. Pain in the fingers and toes may become severe and occur at rest. | Inflammation of a vein just below the skin's surface, due to a blood clot in the vein.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/buergers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350658
Bulimia nervosa,"Bulimia (boo-LEE-me-uh) nervosa, commonly called bulimia, is a serious, potentially life-threatening eating disorder. People with bulimia binge eat. This means people feel like they've lost control over their eating. They eat large amounts of food in one sitting. This often occurs in secret, and they often feel very guilty and shameful. Then they try to get rid of the food and extra calories in an unhealthy way, such as vomiting or misusing laxatives. This is called purging.
If you have bulimia, you probably focus on your weight and body shape even when you're trying to think about other things. You may judge yourself severely and harshly for what you see as flaws in your appearance and personality. Bulimia is related to how you see yourself — not just about food. It can be hard to overcome, and it can be dangerous.
It's important to remember that an eating disorder is not something you choose. Bulimia is a complex illness that affects how your brain works and how you make decisions. But effective treatment can help you feel better about yourself, eat healthier and reverse serious complications.","Bulimia symptoms may include: | Living in fear of gaining weight and trying to lose weight in unhealthy ways. | Repeatedly eating unusually large amounts of food in one sitting. | Feeling a loss of control during binge eating. You may feel like you can't stop eating or can't control what you eat. | Vomiting on purpose or exercising to extremes after binge eating so that you don't gain weight. | Using medicines that make you urinate, called water pills or diuretics, or laxatives or enemas to pass stool when they're not needed. | Fasting, limiting calories or not eating certain foods between binges. | Using dietary supplements or herbal products for weight loss. These products can be dangerous. | Being very unhappy with your body shape and weight. | Letting your body shape and weight guide how you feel about yourself and your worth. | Having extreme mood swings. | People with bulimia may use different methods to purge. The severity of bulimia depends on the number of times a week that you purge and the problems caused by doing so.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bulimia/symptoms-causes/syc-20353615

Some viral hemorrhagic fevers include:
These diseases most often happen in tropical areas, such as Central Africa. In the United States, most people who get them have traveled to one of those areas.
There are vaccines and treatments for only a few types of viral hemorrhagic fevers. Until there are vaccines for more of them, do your best to keep from getting viral hemorrhagic fevers.","Symptoms of viral hemorrhagic fevers vary by disease.

Burns,"Burns are tissue damage that results from too much sun, hot liquids, flames, chemicals, electricity, steam and other sources. Burns can be minor medical problems or life-threatening emergencies.
The treatment of burns depends on where they are on the body and how bad they are. Sunburns and small scalds can often be treated with first aid. Deep or widespread burns and chemical or electrical burns need medical care right away. Some people need treatment at specialized burn centers and monthslong follow-up care.","Burn symptoms vary depending on how deep the skin damage is. It can take a day or two for the symptoms of a severe burn to develop. | First-degree burn, also called superficial burn.This minor burn affects only the outer layer of the skin, which is called the epidermis. It may cause pain and redness or other changes in skin color. | Second-degree burn, also called partial-thickness burn.This type of burn affects both the epidermis and the second layer of skin, which is called the dermis. It may cause swelling and red, white or splotchy skin. Blisters may develop, and pain can be terrible. Deep second-degree burns can cause scarring. | Third-degree burn, also called full-thickness burn.This burn involves all of the layers of skin and sometimes the fat and muscle tissue under the skin. Burned areas may be black, brown or white. The skin may look leathery. Third-degree burns can destroy nerves, so there may be little or no pain.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/burns/symptoms-causes/syc-20370539
Meralgia paresthetica,"Meralgia paresthetica is a condition that causes tingling, numbness and burning pain in the outer thigh. It's caused by compression of the nerve that provides feeling to the skin covering the thigh. Meralgia paresthetica also is known as lateral femoral cutaneous nerve entrapment.
Tight clothing, obesity or weight gain, and pregnancy are common causes of meralgia paresthetica. But meralgia paresthetica also can be due to an injury or a disease such as diabetes.
Meralgia paresthetica often can be relieved with conservative measures, including wearing looser clothing. If symptoms aren't relieved by those measures, treatment may include medicines. Rarely, surgery is needed.",Meralgia paresthetica may cause these symptoms in the outer part of the thigh: | Tingling. | Burning pain. | Decreased feeling or numbness. | Increased sensitivity and pain to even a light touch. | These symptoms commonly occur on one side of your body and might intensify after walking or standing.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/meralgia-paresthetica/symptoms-causes/syc-20355635
Bursitis,"Bursitis (bur-SY-tis) is a painful condition that affects the small, fluid-filled sacs — called bursae (bur-SEE) — that cushion the bones, tendons and muscles near your joints. Bursitis occurs when bursae become inflamed.
The most common locations for bursitis are in the shoulder, elbow and hip. But you can also have bursitis by your knee, heel and the base of your big toe. Bursitis often occurs near joints that perform frequent repetitive motion.
Treatment typically involves resting the affected joint and protecting it from further trauma. In most cases, bursitis pain goes away within a few weeks with proper treatment, but recurrent flare-ups of bursitis are common.","If you have bursitis, the affected joint might: | Feel achy or stiff | Hurt more when you move it or press on it | Look swollen and red",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bursitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353242
Knee bursitis,"Knee bursitis is a condition in which one or more small fluid-filled sacs near the knee joint become inflamed. The sacs are called bursae. Bursae reduce friction and cushion pressure points between bones and tendons, muscles and skin near the joints.
Any of the bursae in the knee can be affected by painful swelling, also called inflammation. But most often, knee bursitis happens over the kneecap or on the inner side of the knee below the joint.
Knee bursitis causes pain and can limit your movement. Treatment often includes a mix of self-care techniques and medical treatments to ease pain and inflammation.","Knee bursitis symptoms vary. They depend on which bursa is affected and what's causing the inflammation. | The affected portion of your knee might feel warm, tender and swollen. You also might feel pain when you move or when you're at rest. | A direct blow to the knee can cause symptoms to come on fast. But knee bursitis often stems from friction and irritation of the bursae. This can occur with jobs that require a lot of kneeling on hard surfaces.

Symptoms can range from diarrhea to life-threatening damage to the colon. The bacterium is often called C. difficile or C. diff.
Illness from C. difficile often occurs after using antibiotic medicines. It mostly affects older adults in hospitals or in long-term care settings. People not in care settings or hospitals also can get C. difficile infection. Some strains of the bacterium that can cause serious infections are more likely to affect younger people.
The bacterium used to be called Clostridium (klos-TRID-e-um) difficile.",Symptoms often begin within 5 to 10 days after starting an antibiotic.

Calciphylaxis,"Calciphylaxis (kal-sih-fuh-LAK-sis) is a rare, serious disease. It involves a buildup of calcium in small blood vessels of fat tissues and skin.
Calciphylaxis symptoms include blood clots, lumps under the skin and painful open sores called ulcers. If an ulcer becomes infected, it can be life-threatening.
The exact cause of calciphylaxis isn't clear. But people with the disease usually have kidney failure. That's a condition in which the kidneys no longer work as they should. Often, these same people also have received kidney failure treatments such as dialysis or a kidney transplant. Calciphylaxis can happen in people without kidney disease too.
Calciphylaxis treatments include various medicines, procedures and surgery. Treatment can help prevent blood clots and infections, reduce calcium buildups, heal sores, and ease pain.","Calciphylaxis symptoms include: | Large netlike patterns on the skin that may look purple-pink in color. | Deep, painful lumps in the skin that can become ulcers. The ulcers often have a black-brown crust that doesn't heal on its own. Ulcers tend to appear in areas with high fat content, such as the stomach, thighs, buttocks and breasts.

Corns and calluses,"Corns and calluses are thick, hardened layers of skin that develop when the skin tries to protect itself against friction or pressure. They often form on feet and toes or hands and fingers.
If you're healthy, you don't need treatment for corns and calluses unless they cause pain or you don't like how they look. For most people, simply removing the source of the friction or pressure makes corns and calluses disappear.","Signs and symptoms of corns and calluses include: | A thick, rough area of skin | A hardened, raised bump | Tenderness or pain under the skin | Flaky, dry or waxy skin | Corns and calluses are not the same thing. | Cornsare smaller and deeper than calluses and have a hard center surrounded by swollen skin. They can be painful when pressed. Hard corns often form on the top of the toes or the outer edge of the small toe.

Cancer,"Cancer refers to any one of a large number of diseases characterized by the development of abnormal cells that divide uncontrollably and have the ability to infiltrate and destroy normal body tissue. Cancer often has the ability to spread throughout your body.
Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the world. But survival rates are improving for many types of cancer, thanks to improvements in cancer screening, treatment and prevention.","Signs and symptoms caused by cancer will vary depending on what part of the body is affected. | Some general signs and symptoms associated with, but not specific to, cancer, include: | Fatigue | Lump or area of thickening that can be felt under the skin | Weight changes, including unintended loss or gain | Skin changes, such as yellowing, darkening or redness of the skin, sores that won't heal, or changes to existing moles | Changes in bowel or bladder habits | Persistent cough or trouble breathing | Difficulty swallowing | Hoarseness | Persistent indigestion or discomfort after eating | Persistent, unexplained muscle or joint pain | Persistent, unexplained fevers or night sweats | Unexplained bleeding or bruising",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20370588
Carcinoma of unknown primary,"Carcinoma of unknown primary is a diagnosis healthcare professionals give when they can't find where a cancer started. A carcinoma of unknown primary is an advanced cancer that has spread in the body.
Most often, health professionals detect a cancer when it grows in the place where it started. The place where a cancer started growing is called the primary cancer. Sometimes health professionals first detect a cancer when it spreads. When cancer spreads it's called metastatic cancer.
In carcinoma of unknown primary, healthcare professionals find the metastatic cancer. But they can't find the primary cancer. Carcinoma of unknown primary also is called occult primary cancer.
Healthcare teams often use the kind of primary cancer you have to help decide on the treatment. If you're found to have carcinoma of unknown primary, this piece of information is missing. Your healthcare team will work to find out what kind of cancer you have.",Signs and symptoms of carcinoma of unknown primary include: | A cough that won't go away. | Feeling very tired. | Fever that doesn't have a clear cause. | Losing weight without trying. | Nausea and vomiting. | Pain in one part of the body. | Swelling of the belly. | Swollen lymph nodes.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carcinoma-unknown-primary/symptoms-causes/syc-20370683
Acute lymphocytic leukemia,"Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow — the spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are made.
The word ""acute"" in acute lymphocytic leukemia comes from the fact that the disease progresses rapidly and creates immature blood cells, rather than mature ones. The word ""lymphocytic"" in acute lymphocytic leukemia refers to the white blood cells called lymphocytes, whichALLaffects. Acute lymphocytic leukemia is also known as acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Acute lymphocytic leukemia is the most common type of cancer in children, and treatments result in a good chance for a cure. Acute lymphocytic leukemia can also occur in adults, though the chance of a cure is greatly reduced.","Signs and symptoms of acute lymphocytic leukemia may include: | Bleeding from the gums | Bone pain | Fever | Frequent infections | Frequent or severe nosebleeds | Lumps caused by swollen lymph nodes in and around the neck, armpits, abdomen or groin | Pale skin | Shortness of breath | Weakness, fatigue or a general decrease in energy",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-lymphocytic-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369077
Anal cancer,"Anal cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the anal canal. The anal canal is a short tube at the end of rectum. Stool passes through the anal canal as it leaves the body.
Anal cancer can cause symptoms such as rectal bleeding, blood in the stool and anal pain. As it grows, it might cause a growth or lump. Sometimes these symptoms might be mistaken for hemorrhoids.
In the past, most people with anal cancer had surgery to remove the cancer. Often this operation involved making a new way for waste to leave the body. Today, most anal cancer treatment involves chemotherapy and radiation therapy. With this approach, surgery might not be needed.",Anal cancer signs and symptoms include: | Bleeding from the anus or rectum. | Blood in the stool. | Pain in the area of the anus. | A mass or growth in the anal canal. | Anal itching. | Having to go to the bathroom more often.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20354140

Bladder cancer,"Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that begins in the cells of the bladder. The bladder is a hollow muscular organ in your lower abdomen that stores urine.
Bladder cancer most often begins in the cells (urothelial cells) that line the inside of your bladder. Urothelial cells are also found in your kidneys and the tubes (ureters) that connect the kidneys to the bladder. Urothelial cancer can happen in the kidneys and ureters, too, but it's much more common in the bladder.
Most bladder cancers are diagnosed at an early stage, when the cancer is highly treatable. But even early-stage bladder cancers can come back after successful treatment. For this reason, people with bladder cancer typically need follow-up tests for years after treatment to look for bladder cancer that recurs.","Bladder cancer signs and symptoms may include: | Blood in urine (hematuria), which may cause urine to appear bright red or cola colored, though sometimes the urine appears normal and blood is detected on a lab test | Frequent urination | Painful urination | Back pain",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bladder-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20356104
Bone cancer,"Bone cancer is a growth of cells that starts in a bone. Bone cancer can start in any bone. But it most often affects the thighbone.
The term ""bone cancer"" doesn't include cancer that starts in another part of the body and spreads to the bones. Instead, cancer that spreads to the bone is named for the place it began. For example, cancer that starts in the lungs and spreads to the bones is still lung cancer. Healthcare professionals might call it lung cancer that has metastasized to the bones.
Cancer that starts in the bones is rare. Different types of bone cancers exist. Some types of bone cancers mostly happen in children. Other types happen mostly in adults.
Common bone cancer treatments include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. The best treatment for your bone cancer depends on the type of bone cancer, which bone is affected and other factors.","Signs and symptoms of bone cancer include: | Bone pain. | Swelling and tenderness near the affected area. | Weakened bone, which can lead to a broken bone. | Feeling very tired. | Losing weight without trying.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bone-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20350217
Carcinoid tumors,"Carcinoid tumors are a type of slow-growing cancer that can arise in several places throughout your body. Carcinoid tumors, which are one subset of tumors called neuroendocrine tumors, usually begin in the digestive tract (stomach, appendix, small intestine, colon, rectum) or in the lungs.
Carcinoid tumors often don't cause signs and symptoms until late in the disease. Carcinoid tumors can produce and release hormones into your body that cause signs and symptoms such as diarrhea or skin flushing.
Treatment for carcinoid tumors usually includes surgery and may include medications.","Some carcinoid tumors don't cause any signs or symptoms. When they do occur, signs and symptoms are usually vague and depend on the location of the tumor.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carcinoid-tumors/symptoms-causes/syc-20351039
Cervical cancer,"Cervical cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the cervix. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina.
Various strains of the human papillomavirus, also called HPV, play a role in causing most cervical cancers.HPVis a common infection that's passed through sexual contact. When exposed toHPV, the body's immune system typically prevents the virus from doing harm. In a small percentage of people, however, the virus survives for years. This contributes to the process that causes some cervical cells to become cancer cells.
You can reduce your risk of developing cervical cancer by having screening tests and receiving a vaccine that protects againstHPVinfection.
When cervical cancer happens, it's often first treated with surgery to remove the cancer. Other treatments may include medicines to kill the cancer cells. Options might include chemotherapy and targeted therapy medicines. Radiation therapy with powerful energy beams also may be used. Sometimes treatment combines radiation with low-dose chemotherapy.","When it starts, cervical cancer might not cause symptoms. As it grows, cervical cancer might cause signs and symptoms, such as: | Vaginal bleeding after intercourse, between periods or after menopause. | Menstrual bleeding that is heavier and lasts longer than usual. | Watery, bloody vaginal discharge that may be heavy and have a foul odor. | Pelvic pain or pain during intercourse.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cervical-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352501
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow — the spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are made.
The term ""chronic"" in chronic lymphocytic leukemia comes from the fact that this leukemia typically progresses more slowly than other types of leukemia. The term ""lymphocytic"" in chronic lymphocytic leukemia comes from the cells affected by the disease — a group of white blood cells called lymphocytes, which help your body fight infection.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia most commonly affects older adults. There are treatments to help control the disease.","Many people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia have no symptoms at first. Signs and symptoms might develop as the cancer progresses.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia, also calledCML, is an uncommon type of cancer of the bone marrow. Bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are made.CMLcauses an increased number of white blood cells in the blood.
The term ""chronic"" in chronic myelogenous leukemia means this cancer tends to progress more slowly than severe forms of leukemia. The term ""myelogenous"" (my-uh-LOHJ-uh-nus) refers to the type of cells affected by this cancer.
Chronic myelogenous leukemia also can be called chronic myeloid leukemia and chronic granulocytic leukemia. It typically affects older adults and rarely occurs in children, though it can occur at any age.
Advances in treatment have improved the prognosis of people with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Most people can achieve remission and live for many years after diagnosis.","Chronic myelogenous leukemia often doesn't cause symptoms. It might be detected during a blood test. | When they occur, symptoms may include: | Bone pain. | Bleeding easily. | Feeling full after eating a small amount of food. | Fatigue. | Fever. | Weight loss without trying. | Loss of appetite. | Pain or fullness below the ribs on the left side. | Excessive sweating during sleep. | Blurry vision caused by bleeding in the back of the eye.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-myelogenous-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352417
Colon cancer,"Colon cancer is a growth of cells that begins in a part of the large intestine called the colon. The colon is the first and longest part of the large intestine. The large intestine is the last part of the digestive system. The digestive system breaks down food for the body to use.
Colon cancer typically affects older adults, though it can happen at any age. It usually begins as small clumps of cells called polyps that form inside the colon. Polyps generally aren't cancerous, but some can turn into colon cancers over time.
Polyps often don't cause symptoms. For this reason, doctors recommend regular screening tests to look for polyps in the colon. Finding and removing polyps helps prevent colon cancer.
If colon cancer develops, many treatments can help control it. Treatments include surgery, radiation therapy and medicines, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy.
Colon cancer is sometimes called colorectal cancer. This term combines colon cancer and rectal cancer, which begins in the rectum.","Many people with colon cancer don't have symptoms at first. When symptoms appear, they'll likely depend on the cancer's size and where it is in the large intestine. | Symptoms of colon cancer can include: | A change in bowel habits, such as more frequent diarrhea or constipation. | Rectal bleeding or blood in the stool. | Ongoing discomfort in the belly area, such as cramps, gas or pain. | A feeling that the bowel doesn't empty all the way during a bowel movement. | Weakness or tiredness. | Losing weight without trying.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669

Endometrial cancer begins in the layer of cells that form the lining of the uterus, called the endometrium. Endometrial cancer is sometimes called uterine cancer. Other types of cancer can form in the uterus, including uterine sarcoma, but they are much less common than endometrial cancer.
Endometrial cancer is often found at an early stage because it causes symptoms. Often the first symptom is irregular vaginal bleeding. If endometrial cancer is found early, surgically removing the uterus often cures it.",Symptoms of endometrial cancer may include: | Vaginal bleeding after menopause. | Bleeding between periods. | Pelvic pain.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/endometrial-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352461
Esophageal cancer,"Esophageal cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the esophagus. The esophagus is a long, hollow tube that runs from the throat to the stomach. The esophagus helps move swallowed food from the back of the throat to the stomach to be digested.
Esophageal cancer usually begins in the cells that line the inside of the esophagus. Esophageal cancer can happen anywhere along the esophagus.
Esophageal cancer is more common in men. Risk factors include drinking alcohol and smoking.
Esophageal cancer treatment often involves surgery to remove the cancer. Other treatments may include chemotherapy, radiation or a combination of the two. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy also may be used.","Esophageal cancer may not cause symptoms early on.

Eye melanoma,"Eye melanoma is a kind of eye cancer that starts in cells within the eye that make melanin. Melanin is most often known as the pigment that gives skin its color. But the eyes have cells that make melanin too. Eye melanoma also is called ocular melanoma, intraocular melanoma and uveal melanoma.
Most eye melanomas form in parts of the eye you can't see when looking in a mirror. That makes eye melanoma hard to notice. And eye melanoma typically doesn't cause symptoms at first.
Eye melanoma can be treated. Treatment for small eye melanomas may not cause vision problems. But treatment for large eye melanomas typically leads to some vision loss.","Eye melanoma may not cause any symptoms. When they do happen, signs and symptoms of eye melanoma can include: | Flashes of light or what look like specks of dust in a person's vision. These are sometimes called floaters. | A growing dark spot in the colored part of the eye, called the iris. | A change in the shape of the pupil. The pupil is the dark circle at the center of the eye. | Poor vision or blurry vision in one eye. | Not being able to see when looking to the side.

Floor of the mouth cancer,"Floor of the mouth cancer is cancer that starts as a growth of cells under the tongue.
Floor of the mouth cancer most often begins in the thin, flat cells that line the inside of the mouth, called squamous cells. When cancer starts in these cells it's called squamous cell carcinoma.
Floor of the mouth cancer causes changes in the look and feel of the tissue under the tongue. These changes may include a lump or a sore that doesn't heal.
Floor of the mouth cancer treatments include surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.",Symptoms of floor of the mouth cancer can include: | Mouth pain. | Sores in the mouth that won't heal. | Trouble moving the tongue. | Loose teeth. | Pain with swallowing. | Weight loss. | Ear pain. | Swelling in the neck that may hurt. | White patches in the mouth that won't go away.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/floor-mouth-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20354179
Gallbladder cancer,"Gallbladder cancer is a growth of cells that begins in the gallbladder.
The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ on the right side of the belly, just beneath the liver. The gallbladder stores a fluid called bile that the liver makes to digest food.
Gallbladder cancer is not common. The chance for a cure is good when gallbladder cancer is found when it's small. But most gallbladder cancers are found when they've grown beyond the gallbladder. Then the chance to survive, called prognosis, often is poor.
Gallbladder cancer may not be found until it's advanced because it may cause no symptoms. When they happen, the symptoms may be like those of common conditions. Also, the gallbladder is hidden inside the body. This makes it easier for gallbladder cancer to grow without being found.","Gallbladder cancer may have no symptoms. When there are signs and symptoms, they may include: | Belly pain, mostly in the upper right part of the belly. | Belly bloating. | A mass you can feel through the skin. | Losing weight without trying. | Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, called jaundice. Yellowing of the skin might be harder to see on Black or brown skin. Jaundice typically happens when the gallbladder cancer is very advanced.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gallbladder-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353370
Stomach cancer,"Stomach cancer, which is also called gastric cancer, is a growth of cells that starts in the stomach. The stomach is in the upper middle part of the belly, just below the ribs. The stomach helps to break down and digest food.
Stomach cancer can happen in any part of the stomach. In most of the world, stomach cancers happen in the main part of the stomach. This part is called the stomach body.
In the United States, stomach cancer is more likely to start by the gastroesophageal junction. This is the part where the long tube that carries food you swallow meets the stomach. The tube that carries food to the stomach is called the esophagus.
Where the cancer starts in the stomach is one factor health care providers think about when making a treatment plan. Other factors might include the cancer's stage and the type of cells involved. Treatment often includes surgery to remove the stomach cancer. Other treatments may be used before and after surgery.
Stomach cancer treatment is most likely to be successful if the cancer is only in the stomach. The prognosis for people with small stomach cancers is quite good. Many can expect to be cured. Most stomach cancers are found when the disease is advanced and a cure is less likely. Stomach cancer that grows through the stomach wall or spreads to other parts of the body is harder to cure.","Signs and symptoms of stomach cancer may include: | Trouble swallowing | Belly pain | Feeling bloated after eating | Feeling full after eating small amounts of food | Not feeling hungry when you would expect to be hungry | Heartburn | Indigestion | Nausea | Vomiting | Losing weight without trying | Feeling very tired | Stools that look black | Stomach cancer doesn't always cause symptoms in its early stages. When they happen, symptoms might include indigestion and pain in the upper part of the belly. Symptoms might not happen until the cancer is advanced. Later stages of stomach cancer might cause symptoms such as feeling very tired, losing weight without trying, vomiting blood and having black stools. | Stomach cancer that spreads to other parts of the body is called metastatic stomach cancer. It causes symptoms specific to where it spreads. For example, when cancer spreads to the lymph nodes it might cause lumps you can feel through the skin. Cancer that spreads to the liver might cause yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes. If cancer spreads within the belly, it might cause fluid to fill the belly. The belly might look swollen.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stomach-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352438
Hairy cell leukemia,"Hairy cell leukemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. The white blood cells help fight off germs. There are a few different types of white blood cells. The white blood cells involved in hairy cell leukemia are called B cells. B cells are also called B lymphocytes.
In hairy cell leukemia, the body makes too manyB cells. The cells don't look like healthyB cells. Instead, they've undergone changes to become leukemia cells. The leukemia cells look ""hairy"" under a microscope.
Hairy cell leukemia cells keep living when healthy cells would die as part of the natural cell life cycle. The leukemia cells build up in the body and cause symptoms.
Hairy cell leukemia often gets worse slowly. Treatment might not need to start right away. When it's needed, treatment is usually with chemotherapy.
Scientists found a type of cancer that looks like hairy cell leukemia, but it gets worse much faster. This other type of cancer is called hairy cell leukemia variant. It's considered a separate type of cancer from hairy cell leukemia, even though it has a similar name.","Hairy cell leukemia might not cause symptoms. Sometimes a health care provider finds it by accident during a blood test for another condition. | When it causes symptoms, hairy cell leukemia might cause: | A feeling of fullness in your belly that may make it uncomfortable to eat more than a little at a time | Fatigue | Easy bruising | Recurring infections | Weakness | Losing weight without trying",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hairy-cell-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20372956
Hodgkin lymphoma (Hodgkin disease),"Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is part of the body's germ-fighting and disease-fighting immune system. Hodgkin lymphoma begins when healthy cells in the lymphatic system change and grow out of control.
The lymphatic system includes lymph nodes. They are found throughout the body. Most lymph nodes are in the abdomen, groin, pelvis, chest, underarms and neck.
The lymphatic system also includes the spleen, thymus, tonsils and bone marrow. Hodgkin lymphoma can affect all these areas and other organs in the body.
Hodgkin lymphoma, which used to be called Hodgkin disease, is one of two broad types of lymphoma. The other is non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Advances in diagnosis and treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma have helped give people with this disease the chance for a full recovery.","Signs and symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma may include: | Painless swelling of lymph nodes in the neck, armpits or groin. | Fever. | Feeling very tired. | Night sweats. | Weight loss that happens without trying. | Itchy skin.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hodgkins-lymphoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352646

Inflammatory breast cancer,"Inflammatory breast cancer is a form of breast cancer that causes breast swelling and skin changes.
Inflammatory breast cancer happens when a growth of cells forms in the breast tissue. The cells break away from where they started to grow and travel to the lymphatic vessels in the skin. The cells can block the vessels and cause the skin on the breast to look swollen. This skin on the breast might look red or purple.
Inflammatory breast cancer is considered a locally advanced cancer. When a cancer is locally advanced, that means it has spread from where it started to nearby tissue and possibly to nearby lymph nodes.
Inflammatory breast cancer can easily be confused with a breast infection, which is a much more common cause of breast swelling and skin changes. Seek medical attention right away if you notice skin changes on your breast.","Inflammatory breast cancer doesn't commonly form a lump, as occurs with other forms of breast cancer. Instead, signs and symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer include: | Fast change in the appearance of one breast, over the course of several weeks. | Thickness, heaviness or swelling of one breast. | Changes in skin color, giving the breast a red, purple, pink or bruised appearance. | Unusual warmth of the affected breast. | Dimpling or ridges on the skin of the affected breast, similar to an orange peel. | Tenderness, pain or aching. | Enlarged lymph nodes under the arm, above the collarbone or below the collarbone. | Flattened nipple or nipple that turns inward on the affected breast. | For inflammatory breast cancer to be diagnosed, these symptoms must have been present for less than six months.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355413
Kidney cancer,"Kidney cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the kidneys. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They're located behind the abdominal organs, with one kidney on each side of the spine.
In adults, renal cell carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer. Other, less common types of kidney cancer can happen. Young children are more likely to develop a kind of kidney cancer called Wilms tumor.
The number of kidney cancers diagnosed each year seems to be increasing. One reason for this may be the fact that imaging techniques such as CT scans are being used more often. These tests may lead to the incidental discovery of more kidney cancers. Kidney cancer is often found when the cancer is small and confined to the kidney.","Kidney cancer doesn't usually cause symptoms at first. In time, signs and symptoms may develop, including: | Blood in the urine, which may appear pink, red or cola colored. | Loss of appetite. | Pain in the side or back that doesn't go away. | Tiredness. | Unexplained weight loss.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352664
Leukemia,"Leukemia is cancer of the body's blood-forming tissues, including the bone marrow and the lymphatic system.
Many types of leukemia exist. Some forms of leukemia are more common in children. Other forms of leukemia occur mostly in adults.
Leukemia usually involves the white blood cells. Your white blood cells are potent infection fighters — they normally grow and divide in an orderly way, as your body needs them. But in people with leukemia, the bone marrow produces an excessive amount of abnormal white blood cells, which don't function properly.
Treatment for leukemia can be complex — depending on the type of leukemia and other factors. But there are strategies and resources that can help make your treatment successful.","Leukemia symptoms vary, depending on the type of leukemia. Common leukemia signs and symptoms include: | Fever or chills | Persistent fatigue, weakness | Frequent or severe infections | Losing weight without trying | Swollen lymph nodes, enlarged liver or spleen | Easy bleeding or bruising | Recurrent nosebleeds | Tiny red spots in your skin (petechiae) | Excessive sweating, especially at night | Bone pain or tenderness",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20374373
Liver cancer,"Liver cancer is cancer that begins in the cells of your liver. Your liver is a football-sized organ that sits in the upper right portion of your abdomen, beneath your diaphragm and above your stomach.
Several types of cancer can form in the liver. The most common type of liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma, which begins in the main type of liver cell (hepatocyte). Other types of liver cancer, such as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and hepatoblastoma, are much less common.
Cancer that spreads to the liver is more common than cancer that begins in the liver cells. Cancer that begins in another area of the body — such as the colon, lung or breast — and then spreads to the liver is called metastatic cancer rather than liver cancer. This type of cancer is named after the organ in which it began — such as metastatic colon cancer to describe cancer that begins in the colon and spreads to the liver.","Most people don't have signs and symptoms in the early stages of primary liver cancer. When signs and symptoms do appear, they may include: | Losing weight without trying | Loss of appetite | Upper abdominal pain | Nausea and vomiting | General weakness and fatigue | Abdominal swelling | Yellow discoloration of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice) | White, chalky stools",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/liver-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353659
Lung cancer,"Lung cancer is a kind of cancer that starts as a growth of cells in the lungs. The lungs are two spongy organs in the chest that control breathing.
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.
People who smoke have the greatest risk of lung cancer. The risk of lung cancer increases with the length of time and number of cigarettes smoked. Quitting smoking, even after smoking for many years, significantly lowers the chances of developing lung cancer. Lung cancer also can happen in people who have never smoked.","Lung cancer typically doesn't cause symptoms early on. Symptoms of lung cancer usually happen when the disease is advanced. | Signs and symptoms of lung cancer that happen in and around the lungs may include: | A new cough that doesn't go away. | Chest pain. | Coughing up blood, even a small amount. | Hoarseness. | Shortness of breath. | Wheezing. | Signs and symptoms that happen when lung cancer spreads to other parts of the body may include: | Bone pain. | Headache. | Losing weight without trying. | Loss of appetite. | Swelling in the face or neck.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lung-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20374620
Male breast cancer,"Male breast cancer is a rare cancer that begins as a growth of cells in the breast tissue of men.
Breast cancer is typically thought of as a condition that happens in women. But everyone is born with some breast tissue. So anyone can get breast cancer.
Male breast cancer is rare. It happens most often in older men, though it can occur at any age.
Treatment for male breast cancer typically involves surgery to remove the breast tissue. Other treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, may be recommended as well.","Signs and symptoms of male breast cancer can include: | A painless lump or thickening of the skin on the chest. | Changes to the skin covering the chest, such as dimpling, puckering, scaling or changes in the color of the skin. | Changes to the nipple, such as changes in the skin color or scaling, or a nipple that begins to turn inward. | Discharge or bleeding from the nipple.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/male-breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20374740
Merkel cell carcinoma,"Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare type of skin cancer. It most often appears as a bump on the face, head or neck. Merkel cell carcinoma also is called neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin.
Merkel cell carcinoma most often happens in people older than 50. Long-term sun exposure or a weakened immune system may raise the risk of getting this cancer.
Merkel cell carcinoma tends to grow fast and to spread quickly to other parts of the body. Treatment may depend on whether the cancer has spread beyond the skin.","The first symptom of Merkel cell carcinoma most often is a growth on the skin. This skin cancer can happen anywhere on the body. It happens most often on skin that typically gets sunlight. In white people, the growth is most likely to be on the head or neck. In Black people, the growth more often is on the legs. | A Merkel cell carcinoma can cause: | A bump on the skin that often is painless. | A bump that grows quickly. | A bump whose two sides don't match. | A bump that looks pink, purple, red-brown, or the same color as the skin around it.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/merkel-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20351030
Mesothelioma,"Mesothelioma is a cancer that starts as a growth of cells in the mesothelium. The mesothelium is a thin layer of tissue that covers many internal organs.
Mesothelioma is pronounced me-zoe-thee-lee-O-muh. It most often happens in the tissue around the lungs. This is called pleural mesothelioma. Mesothelioma also can happen in the tissues in the belly, around the heart and around the testicles.
Mesothelioma, which is sometimes called malignant mesothelioma, is a fast-growing and deadly form of cancer. There are mesothelioma treatments. But for many people with mesothelioma, there is no cure.",Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma depend on where the cancer starts. | Pleural mesotheliomaaffects the tissue around the lungs. Symptoms may include: | Chest pain. | Painful coughing. | Shortness of breath. | Lumps under the skin on the chest. | Tiredness. | Weight loss without trying. | Peritoneal mesotheliomaaffects tissue in the belly. Symptoms may include: | Belly pain. | Belly swelling. | Nausea. | Tiredness. | Weight loss without trying. | Other types of mesotheliomaare very rare. Not as much is known about these other types. | Pericardial mesothelioma affects tissue around the heart. It may cause trouble breathing and chest pains. | Mesothelioma of tunica vaginalis affects tissue around the testicles. It may first appear as swelling or a mass on a testicle.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mesothelioma/symptoms-causes/syc-20375022

The mouth also is called the oral cavity. Cancer that happens in the mouth is sometimes called oral cancer or oral cavity cancer.
Mouth cancer is one of several cancers that are considered to be types of head and neck cancer. Mouth cancer and other head and neck cancers often have similar treatments.",Signs and symptoms of mouth cancer may include: | A lip or mouth sore that won't heal. | A white or reddish patch on the inside of the mouth. | Loose teeth. | A growth or lump inside the mouth. | Mouth pain. | Ear pain. | Difficult or painful swallowing.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mouth-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20350997
Multiple myeloma,"Multiple myeloma is a cancer that forms in a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell. Healthy plasma cells help fight infections by making proteins called antibodies. Antibodies find and attack germs.
In multiple myeloma, cancerous plasma cells build up in bone marrow. The bone marrow is the soft matter inside bones where blood cells are made. In the bone marrow, the cancer cells crowd out healthy blood cells. Rather than make helpful antibodies, the cancer cells make proteins that don't work right. This leads to complications of multiple myeloma.
Multiple myeloma treatment isn't always needed right away. If the multiple myeloma is slow growing and isn't causing symptoms, close watching might be the first step. For people with multiple myeloma who need treatment, there are a number of ways to help control the disease.","Early in multiple myeloma, there might be no symptoms. When signs and symptoms happen, they can include: | Bone pain, especially in the spine, chest or hips. | Nausea. | Constipation. | Loss of appetite. | Mental fogginess or confusion. | Tiredness. | Infections. | Weight loss. | Weakness. | Thirst. | Needing to urinate often.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-myeloma/symptoms-causes/syc-20353378
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is cancer that starts as a growth of cells in the nasopharynx. The nasopharynx is the upper part of the throat. It sits behind the nose.
Nasopharyngeal (nay-zoh-fuh-RIN-jee-ul) carcinoma is rare in the United States. It happens much more often in other parts of the world, mainly Southeast Asia.
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is hard to find early. That's most likely because the nasopharynx isn't easy to examine. And there may be no symptoms at first.
Treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma usually involves radiation therapy, chemotherapy or a mix of the two. Work with your healthcare professional to find the approach that's right for you.","Nasopharyngeal carcinoma may not cause signs or symptoms at first. When it does cause symptoms, they might include: | A lump in your neck caused by a swollen lymph node. | Bleeding from the nose. | Bloody saliva. | Double vision. | Ear infections. | Facial numbness. | Headaches. | Hearing loss. | Nasal stuffiness. | Ringing in the ears, called tinnitus. | Sore throat.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20375529
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma,"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is made up of organs, glands, tubelike vessels and clusters of cells called lymph nodes. It's part of the body's germ-fighting immune system.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma happens when germ-fighting cells in the lymphatic system grow out of control. The cells can form growths, called tumors, throughout the body.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a broad group of lymphomas. There are many subtypes in this group. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma are among the most common subtypes. The other broad group of lymphoma is Hodgkin lymphoma.
Advances in diagnosis and treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma have helped improve the prognosis for people with this condition.","Signs and symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma may include: | Swollen lymph nodes in the neck, armpits or groin. | Belly pain or swelling. | Chest pain, coughing or trouble breathing. | Feeling very tired. | Fever. | Night sweats. | Weight loss without trying.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/non-hodgkins-lymphoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20375680
Ovarian cancer,"Ovarian cancer is a growth of cells that forms in the ovaries. The cells multiply quickly and can invade and destroy healthy body tissue.
The female reproductive system contains two ovaries, one on each side of the uterus. The ovaries — each about the size of an almond — produce eggs (ova) as well as the hormones estrogen and progesterone.
Ovarian cancer treatment usually involves surgery and chemotherapy.","When ovarian cancer first develops, it might not cause any noticeable symptoms. When ovarian cancer symptoms happen, they're usually attributed to other, more common conditions. | Signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer may include: | Abdominal bloating or swelling | Quickly feeling full when eating | Weight loss | Discomfort in the pelvic area | Fatigue | Back pain | Changes in bowel habits, such as constipation | A frequent need to urinate",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20375941
Pancreatic cancer,"Pancreatic cancer is a type of cancer that begins as a growth of cells in the pancreas. The pancreas lies behind the lower part of the stomach. It makes enzymes that help digest food and hormones that help manage blood sugar.
The most common type of pancreatic cancer is pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. This type begins in the cells that line the ducts that carry digestive enzymes out of the pancreas.
Pancreatic cancer rarely is found at its early stages when the chance of curing it is greatest. This is because it often doesn't cause symptoms until after it has spread to other organs.
Your health care team considers the extent of your pancreatic cancer when creating your treatment plan. Treatment options may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy or a mix of these.","Pancreatic cancer often doesn't cause symptoms until the disease is advanced. When they happen, signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer may include: | Belly pain that spreads to the sides or back. | Loss of appetite. | Weight loss. | Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, called jaundice. | Light-colored or floating stools. | Dark-colored urine. | Itching. | New diagnosis of diabetes or diabetes that's getting harder to control. | Pain and swelling in an arm or leg, which might be caused by a blood clot. | Tiredness or weakness.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421
Paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system,"Paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system are a group of rare conditions that develop in some people who have cancer. In addition to the nervous system, paraneoplastic syndromes also can affect other organ systems including hormones, skin, blood and joints.
Paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system occur when cancer-fighting agents of the immune system also attack parts of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves or muscle.
Depending on where the nervous system is affected, paraneoplastic syndromes can affect muscle movement, coordination, sensory perception, memory, thinking skills or even sleep.
Sometimes the injury to the nervous system can be reversed with therapy directed toward the cancer and the immune system. But sometimes paraneoplastic syndromes can result in permanent damage to the nervous system.
Treating the cancer and other therapies may prevent further damage and improve symptoms and quality of life.","Symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system can develop relatively quickly, often over days to weeks. They often begin even before a cancer is diagnosed. | Symptoms vary depending on the body part being injured, and may include: | Trouble walking. | Trouble with balance. | Loss of muscle coordination. | Loss of muscle tone or weakness. | Loss of fine motor skills, such as picking up objects. | Trouble swallowing. | Slurred speech or stuttering. | Memory loss and other thinking impairment. | Vision changes. | Trouble sleeping. | Seizures. | Hallucinations. | Movements that can't be controlled.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/paraneoplastic-syndromes/symptoms-causes/syc-20355687
Prostate cancer,"Prostate cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the prostate. The prostate is a small gland that helps make semen. It's found just below the bladder. The prostate is part of the male reproductive system.
Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer. Prostate cancer is usually found early, and it often grows slowly. Most people with prostate cancer are cured.
People diagnosed with early prostate cancer often have many treatment options to consider. It can feel overwhelming to learn about all the options and make a choice. Treatments may include surgery, radiation therapy or carefully watching the prostate cancer to see if it grows.
If the cancer grows beyond the prostate or if it spreads, there are still many treatment options. Prostate cancer that spreads can be more difficult to cure. But even when a cure isn't possible, treatments can slow the growth of the cancer and help you live longer.","Prostate cancer may not cause symptoms at first. Most prostate cancers are found at an early stage. This means that the cancer is only in the prostate. An early-stage prostate cancer often doesn't cause symptoms. | When they happen, early-stage prostate cancer signs and symptoms can include: | Blood in the urine, which might make the urine look pink, red or cola-colored. | Blood in the semen. | Needing to urinate more often. | Trouble getting started when trying to urinate. | Waking up to urinate more often at night. | If the prostate cancer spreads, other symptoms can happen. Prostate cancer that spreads to other parts of the body is called metastatic prostate cancer. It also might be called stage 4 prostate cancer or advanced prostate cancer. | Signs and symptoms of advanced prostate cancer can include: | Accidental leaking of urine. | Back pain. | Bone pain. | Difficulty getting an erection, called erectile dysfunction. | Feeling very tired. | Losing weight without trying. | Weakness in the arms or legs.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prostate-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353087
Rectal cancer,"Rectal cancer is a kind of cancer that starts as a growth of cells in the rectum. The rectum is the last several inches of the large intestine. It starts at the end of the final segment of the colon and ends when it reaches the short, narrow passage known as the anus.
Cancer inside the rectum and cancer inside the colon are often referred to together as colorectal cancer.
While rectal and colon cancers are similar in many ways, their treatments are quite different. This is mainly because the rectum is barely separated from other organs and structures. It sits in a tight space that can make surgery to remove rectal cancer complex.
Rectal cancer treatment usually involves surgery to remove the cancer. Other treatments may include chemotherapy, radiation or a combination of the two. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy also may be used.","Rectal cancer may not cause symptoms early on. Symptoms of rectal cancer usually happen when the disease is advanced. | Signs and symptoms of rectal cancer include: | A change in bowel habits, such as diarrhea, constipation or a more-frequent need to pass stool. | A feeling that the bowel doesn't empty completely. | Abdominal pain. | Dark maroon or bright red blood in stool. | Narrow stool. | Weight loss that happens without trying. | Weakness or fatigue.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rectal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352884
Retinoblastoma,"Retinoblastoma is a kind of eye cancer that starts as a growth of cells in the retina. The retina is the light-sensitive lining on the inside of the eye.
The retina is made up of nerve tissue that senses light as it comes in through the front of the eye. The light causes the retina to send signals to the brain. The brain interprets the signals as images.
Retinoblastoma happens most often in young children. It's usually diagnosed before age 2. It most often affects one eye. Sometimes it happens in both eyes.
There are several treatments for retinoblastoma. For most children, treatment doesn't require removing the eye to get rid of the cancer. The outlook for children diagnosed with retinoblastoma is quite good.",Retinoblastoma signs and symptoms include: | A white color in the center circle of the eye when light is shone in the eye. It might show up in flash photos. | Eye redness. | Eye swelling. | Eyes that seem to be looking in different directions. | Vision loss.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/retinoblastoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20351008
Skin cancer,"Skin cancer — the abnormal growth of skin cells — most often develops on skin exposed to the sun. But this common form of cancer can also occur on areas of your skin not ordinarily exposed to sunlight.
There are three major types of skin cancer — basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma.
You can reduce your risk of skin cancer by limiting or avoiding exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Checking your skin for suspicious changes can help detect skin cancer at its earliest stages. Early detection of skin cancer gives you the greatest chance for successful skin cancer treatment.",,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/skin-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20377605
Soft tissue sarcoma,"Soft tissue sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that starts as a growth of cells in the body's soft tissues. The soft tissues connect, support and surround other body structures. Soft tissues include muscle, fat, blood vessels, nerves, tendons and linings of the joints.
Soft tissue sarcoma can happen anywhere in the body. It happens most often in the arms, legs and belly.
More than 50 types of soft tissue sarcoma exist. Some types are more likely to affect children. Others affect mostly adults. These cancers can be hard to diagnose because they may be mistaken for many other types of growths.
Soft tissue sarcoma treatment usually involves surgery. Other treatments might include radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Treatment depends on the size, type and location of the cancer and how quickly it grows.","A soft tissue sarcoma may not cause any symptoms at first. As the cancer grows, it may cause: | A noticeable lump or swelling. | Pain, if the growth presses on nerves or muscles.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/soft-tissue-sarcoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20377725
Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin,"Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is a type of cancer that starts as a growth of cells on the skin. It starts in cells called squamous cells. The squamous cells make up the middle and outer layers of the skin. Squamous cell carcinoma is a common type of skin cancer.
Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is usually not life-threatening. But if it's not treated, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin can grow large or spread to other parts of the body. The growth of the cancer can cause serious complications.
Most squamous cell carcinomas of the skin are caused by too much ultraviolet (UV) radiation.UVradiation comes either from sunlight or from tanning beds or lamps. Protecting your skin fromUVlight can help reduce the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and other forms of skin cancer.
Squamous cell carcinomas can be anywhere on the skin. In people who sunburn easily, the cancer is usually found on areas of skin that have had a lot of sun. In people with Black and brown skin, squamous cell carcinomas are more likely to be on skin that isn't exposed to sun, such as the genitals.","Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin most often occurs on sun-exposed skin. This includes the scalp, the backs of the hands, the ears or the lips. But it can occur anywhere on the body. It can even occur inside the mouth, on the bottoms of the feet or on the genitals. When squamous cell carcinoma of the skin happens in people with Black and brown skin, it tends to happen in places that aren't exposed to the sun. | Symptoms of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin include: | A firm bump on the skin, called a nodule. The nodule might be the same color as the skin, or it might look different. It can look pink, red, black or brown, depending on skin color. | A flat sore with a scaly crust. | A new sore or raised area on an old scar or sore. | A rough, scaly patch on the lip that may become an open sore. | A sore or rough patch inside the mouth. | A raised patch or wartlike sore on or in the anus or on the genitals.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/squamous-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352480
Testicular cancer,"Testicular cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the testicles. The testicles, which are also called testes, are in the scrotum. The scrotum is a loose bag of skin underneath the penis. The testicles make sperm and the hormone testosterone.
Testicular cancer isn't a common type of cancer. It can happen at any age, but it happens most often between the ages of 15 and 45.
The first sign of testicular cancer often is a bump or lump on a testicle. The cancer cells can grow quickly. They often spread outside the testicle to other parts of the body.
Testicular cancer is highly treatable, even when it spreads to other parts of the body. Treatments depend on the type of testicular cancer that you have and how far it has spread. Common treatments include surgery and chemotherapy.",Signs and symptoms of testicular cancer include: | A lump or swelling in either testicle | A feeling of heaviness in the scrotum | A dull ache in the lower belly or groin | Sudden swelling in the scrotum | Pain or discomfort in a testicle or the scrotum | Enlargement or tenderness of the breast tissue | Back pain | Usually testicular cancer only happens in one testicle.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/testicular-cancer-care/symptoms-causes/syc-20352986
Throat cancer,"Throat cancer refers cancer that develops in your throat (pharynx) or voice box (larynx).
Your throat is a muscular tube that begins behind your nose and ends in your neck. Throat cancer most often begins in the flat cells that line the inside of your throat.
Your voice box sits just below your throat and also is susceptible to throat cancer. The voice box is made of cartilage and contains the vocal cords that vibrate to make sound when you talk.","Signs and symptoms of throat cancer may include: | A cough | Changes in your voice, such as hoarseness or not speaking clearly | Difficulty swallowing | Ear pain | A lump or sore that doesn't heal | A sore throat | Weight loss",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/throat-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20366462
Thyroid cancer,"Thyroid cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the thyroid. The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of the neck, just below the Adam's apple. The thyroid produces hormones that regulate heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature and weight.
Thyroid cancer might not cause any symptoms at first. But as it grows, it can cause signs and symptoms, such as swelling in your neck, voice changes and difficulty swallowing.
Several types of thyroid cancer exist. Most types grow slowly, though some types can be very aggressive. Most thyroid cancers can be cured with treatment.
Thyroid cancer rates seem to be increasing. The increase may be caused by improved imaging technology that allows health care providers to find small thyroid cancers on CT and MRI scans done for other conditions (incidental thyroid cancers). Thyroid cancers found in this way are usually small cancers that respond well to treatments.","Most thyroid cancers don't cause any signs or symptoms early in the disease. As thyroid cancer grows, it may cause: | A lump (nodule) that can be felt through the skin on your neck | A feeling that close-fitting shirt collars are becoming too tight | Changes to your voice, including increasing hoarseness | Difficulty swallowing | Swollen lymph nodes in your neck | Pain in your neck and throat",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thyroid-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20354161
Vaginal cancer,"Vaginal cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the vagina. The cells multiply quickly and can invade and destroy healthy body tissue.
The vagina is part of the female reproductive system. It's a muscular tube that connects the uterus with the outer genitals. The vagina is sometimes called the birth canal.
Cancer that begins in the vagina is rare. Most cancer that happens in the vagina starts somewhere else and spreads to the vagina.
Vaginal cancer that's diagnosed when it's confined to the vagina has the best chance for a cure. When the cancer spreads beyond the vagina, it's much harder to treat.","Vaginal cancer may not cause any symptoms at first. As it grows, vaginal cancer may cause signs and symptoms, such as: | Vaginal bleeding that isn't typical, such as after menopause or after sex. | Vaginal discharge. | A lump or mass in the vagina. | Painful urination. | Frequent urination. | Constipation. | Pelvic pain.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vaginal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352447
Vulvar cancer,"Vulvar cancer is cancer that starts as a growth of cells on the vulva. The vulva is the area of skin that surrounds the urethra and vagina. It includes the clitoris and labia.
Vulvar cancer commonly forms as a lump or sore on the vulva that often causes itching. Though it can happen at any age, vulvar cancer is usually diagnosed in older adults.
Vulvar cancer treatment often starts with surgery to remove the cancer and a small amount of surrounding healthy tissue. Sometimes vulvar cancer surgery requires removing the entire vulva. The earlier vulvar cancer is diagnosed, the less likely an extensive surgery is needed for treatment.","Signs and symptoms of vulvar cancer may include: | A lump, wartlike bump or an open sore on the vulva. | Bleeding in the genital area that isn't from menstruation. | Itching of the skin of the vulva that doesn't go away. | Pain and tenderness that affects the vulva. | Skin changes, such as changes in the color of the skin of the vulva or thickening of the skin.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vulvar-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20368051
Wilms tumor,"Wilms tumor is a rare kidney cancer that mainly affects children. Also known as nephroblastoma, it's the most common cancer of the kidneys in children. Wilms tumor most often affects children ages 3 to 4. It becomes much less common after age 5, but it can affect older children and even adults.
Wilms tumor mostly occurs in just one kidney. But it can sometimes be in both kidneys at the same time.
Over the years, progress in the diagnosis and treatment of Wilms tumor has greatly improved the prognosis for children with this disease. With treatment, the outlook for most children with Wilms tumor is good.","Symptoms of Wilms tumor vary a lot. Some children don't seem to have any symptoms. But others with Wilms tumor have one or more of these symptoms: | A mass in the stomach area that can be felt. | Swelling in the stomach area. | Pain in the stomach area. | Other symptoms might include: | Fever. | Blood in the urine. | Low red blood cell level, also known as anemia. | High blood pressure.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/wilms-tumor/symptoms-causes/syc-20352655
Oral thrush,"Oral thrush, also called oral candidiasis (kan-dih-DIE-uh-sis), is a condition in which the fungus Candida albicans builds up in the mouth. It's natural for candida, a yeast, to live in the mouth. But sometimes it can grow too much and cause symptoms.
Oral thrush causes creamy white patches or spots, usually on the tongue or inner cheeks. Sometimes oral thrush may spread to the roof of the mouth, gums or tonsils, or the back of your throat.
Although oral thrush can affect anyone, it's more likely to occur in babies and older adults because they have lower immunity. It's also more likely to occur in other people with weakened immune systems or certain health conditions or people who take certain medicines. Oral thrush is a minor problem if you're healthy. But if you have a weakened immune system, symptoms may be more serious and harder to control.",,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/oral-thrush/symptoms-causes/syc-20353533
Yeast infection (vaginal),"A vaginal yeast infection is a fungal infection. It causes irritation, discharge and itching of the vagina and the vulva. Vaginal yeast infection also is called vaginal candidiasis.
Vaginal yeast infection affects most people assigned female at birth at some point in life. Many have at least two infections.
People who don't have sex can get a vaginal yeast infection. So it isn't though of as a sexually transmitted infection. But you can get vaginal yeast infections through sex.
There's a higher risk of vaginal yeast infection when you start having sex. And some vaginal yeast infections may be linked to sexual contact between the mouth and genital area, called oral-genital sex.
Medicines can treat vaginal yeast infections. Yeast infections that happen four times or more a year may need a longer treatment course and a plan to prevent them.","Yeast infection symptoms range from mild to moderate. They may include: | Itching and irritation in the vagina and tissues at the vaginal opening, called the vulva. | A burning feeling, mainly during intercourse or while urinating. | Redness and swelling of the vulva. Redness may be harder to see on Black or brown skin than on white skin. | Vaginal pain and soreness. | Thick, white vaginal shedding of fluid and cells, called discharge, with little or no odor. The discharge looks like cottage cheese.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/yeast-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20378999
Canker sore,"Canker sores, also called aphthous ulcers, are small, shallow lesions that develop on the soft tissues in your mouth or at the base of your gums. Unlike cold sores, canker sores don't occur on the surface of your lips and they aren't contagious. They can be painful, however, and can make eating and talking difficult.
Most canker sores go away on their own in a week or two. Check with your doctor or dentist if you have unusually large or painful canker sores or canker sores that don't seem to heal.","Most canker sores are round or oval with a white or yellow center and a red border. They form inside your mouth — on or under your tongue, inside your cheeks or lips, at the base of your gums, or on your soft palate. You might notice a tingling or burning sensation a day or two before the sores actually appear. | There are several types of canker sores, including minor, major and herpetiform sores.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/canker-sore/symptoms-causes/syc-20370615
Carbon monoxide poisoning,"Carbon monoxide poisoning occurs when carbon monoxide builds up in the blood. When too much carbon monoxide is in the air, the body replaces the oxygen in the red blood cells with carbon monoxide. This can lead to serious tissue damage, or even death.
Carbon monoxide is gas that has no odor, taste or color. Burning fuels, including gas, wood, propane or charcoal, make carbon monoxide. Appliances and engines that aren't well vented can cause the gas to build up to dangerous levels. A tightly enclosed space makes the buildup worse.
Anyone exposed to carbon monoxide needs to get into fresh air and seek medical care right away. Call emergency medical services (EMS) or dial 911 right away for someone who's in a coma or can't respond.","Carbon monoxide poisoning affects the brain and heart the most. Exposure over time might lead to symptoms that can be mistaken for the flu without the fever. Clearer symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning can include: | Headache. | Weakness. | Dizziness. | Nausea or vomiting. | Shortness of breath. | Confusion. | Blurred vision. | Drowsiness. | Loss of muscle control. | Loss of consciousness. | Symptoms related to the nervous system and brain can come on after recovery from carbon monoxide poisoning. The risk of these is higher in people who lost consciousness from the carbon monoxide and older people. Symptoms might include: | Memory loss. | Personality changes. | Movement problems. | Carbon monoxide poisoning can be especially dangerous for people who are asleep, drugged or drunk. Carbon monoxide can cause brain damage or death before anyone realizes there's a problem.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carbon-monoxide/symptoms-causes/syc-20370642

Sudden cardiac arrest,"Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the sudden loss of all heart activity due to an irregular heart rhythm. Breathing stops. The person becomes unconscious. Without immediate treatment, sudden cardiac arrest can lead to death.
Emergency treatment for sudden cardiac arrest includes cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and shocks to the heart with a device called an automated external defibrillator (AED). Survival is possible with fast, appropriate medical care.
Sudden cardiac arrest isn't the same as a heart attack. A heart attack happens when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked. Sudden cardiac arrest is not due to a blockage. However, a heart attack can cause a change in the heart's electrical activity that leads to sudden cardiac arrest.","Symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest are immediate and severe and include: | Sudden collapse. | No pulse. | No breathing. | Loss of consciousness. | Sometimes other symptoms occur before sudden cardiac arrest. These might include: | Chest discomfort. | Shortness of breath. | Weakness. | Fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heartbeat called palpitations. | But sudden cardiac arrest often occurs with no warning.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sudden-cardiac-arrest/symptoms-causes/syc-20350634

Cardiomyopathy,"Cardiomyopathy (kahr-dee-o-my-OP-uh-thee) is a disease of the heart muscle. It causes the heart to have a harder time pumping blood to the rest of the body, which can lead to symptoms of heart failure. Cardiomyopathy also can lead to some other serious heart conditions.
There are various types of cardiomyopathy. The main types include dilated, hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathy. Treatment includes medicines and sometimes surgically implanted devices and heart surgery. Some people with severe cardiomyopathy need a heart transplant. Treatment depends on the type of cardiomyopathy and how serious it is.","Some people with cardiomyopathy don't ever get symptoms. For others, symptoms appear as the condition becomes worse. Cardiomyopathy symptoms can include: | Shortness of breath or trouble breathing with activity or even at rest. | Chest pain, especially after physical activity or heavy meals. | Heartbeats that feel rapid, pounding or fluttering. | Swelling of the legs, ankles, feet, stomach area and neck veins. | Bloating of the stomach area due to fluid buildup. | Cough while lying down. | Trouble lying flat to sleep. | Fatigue, even after getting rest. | Dizziness. | Fainting. | Symptoms tend to get worse unless they are treated.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a disease in which the heart muscle becomes thickened, also called hypertrophied. The thickened heart muscle can make it harder for the heart to pump blood.
Many people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy don't realize they have it. That's because they have few, if any, symptoms. But in a small number of people withHCM, the thickened heart muscle can cause serious symptoms. These include shortness of breath and chest pain. Some people withHCMhave changes in the heart's electrical system. These changes can result in life-threatening irregular heartbeats or sudden death.","Symptoms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can include one or more of the following: | Chest pain, especially during exercise. | Fainting, especially during or just after exercise or other physical activity. | Sensation of fast, fluttering or pounding heartbeats called palpitations. | Shortness of breath, especially during exercise.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350198

Carotid artery disease,"Carotid artery disease occurs when fatty deposits, called plaques, clog the blood vessels that deliver blood to the brain and head (carotid arteries). The clog increases the risk of stroke. Stroke is a medical emergency that occurs when the brain loses all or much of its blood supply.
During a stroke, the brain doesn't get oxygen and brain cells begin to die within minutes. Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in the U.S.
Carotid artery disease often develops slowly. The first sign of the condition might be a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). ATIAis a temporary shortage of blood flow to the brain.
Treatment of carotid artery disease usually involves lifestyle changes, medicines and sometimes surgery.","In its early stages, carotid artery disease often doesn't have symptoms. The condition might not be obvious until it's serious enough to deprive the brain of blood, causing a stroke orTIA. | Symptoms of a stroke orTIAinclude: | Sudden numbness or weaknessin the face or limbs, often on one side of the body. | Sudden trouble speakingand understanding speech. | Sudden trouble seeingin one or both eyes. | Sudden dizzinessor loss of balance. | Sudden, severe headachewith no known cause.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carotid-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20360519
Carpal tunnel syndrome,"Carpal tunnel syndrome is one of the most common hand conditions. It is caused by pressure on the median nerve in the carpal tunnel of the wrist. The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway surrounded by bones and ligaments on the palm side of the hand. When the median nerve is compressed, symptoms can include numbness, tingling and weakness in the thumb and fingers.
Wrist anatomy, health conditions and possibly repetitive hand motions can contribute to carpal tunnel syndrome.
Proper treatment usually relieves the tingling and numbness and restores hand function.","Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome usually start gradually and include: | Tingling and numbness.Tingling and numbness may occur in the fingers or hand. Usually the thumb, index, middle and ring fingers are affected, but not the little finger. You might have a feeling like an electric shock in these fingers. These symptoms often occur while holding a steering wheel, phone or newspaper, or they may wake you from sleep.The sensation also can travel from the wrist up the arm.Many people ""shake out"" their hands to try to relieve their symptoms. The numb feeling may become constant over time. | Weakness.People with carpal tunnel syndrome may experience weakness in the hand and drop objects. This may be due to numbness or to weakness of the thumb's pinching muscles, which also are controlled by the median nerve.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carpal-tunnel-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20355603
Childhood apraxia of speech,"Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) is a rare speech disorder. Children with this disorder have trouble controlling their lips, jaws and tongues when speaking.
InCAS, the brain has trouble planning for speech movement. The brain isn't able to properly direct the movements needed for speech. The speech muscles aren't weak, but the muscles don't form words the right way.
To speak correctly, the brain has to make plans that tell the speech muscles how to move the lips, jaw and tongue. The movements usually result in accurate sounds and words spoken at the proper speed and rhythm.CASaffects this process.
CASis often treated with speech therapy. During speech therapy, a speech-language pathologist teaches the child to practice the correct way to say words, syllables and phrases.","Children with childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) may have a variety of speech symptoms. Symptoms vary depending on a child's age and the severity of the speech problems. | CAScan result in: | Babbling less or making fewer vocal sounds than is typical between the ages of 7 to 12 months. | Speaking first words late, typically after ages 12 to 18 months old. | Using a limited number of consonants and vowels. | Often leaving out sounds when speaking. | Using speech that is hard to understand. | These symptoms are usually noticed between ages 18 months and 2 years. Symptoms at this age may indicate suspectedCAS. SuspectedCASmeans a child may potentially have this speech disorder. The child's speech development should be watched to determine if therapy should begin. | Children usually produce more speech between ages 2 and 4. Signs that may indicateCASinclude: | Vowel and consonant distortions. | Pauses between syllables or words. | Voicing errors, such as ""pie"" sounding like ""bye."" | Many children withCAShave trouble getting their jaws, lips and tongues to the correct positions to make a sound. They also may have a hard time moving smoothly to the next sound. | Many children withCASalso have language problems, such as reduced vocabulary or trouble with word order. | Some symptoms may be unique to children withCAS, which helps to make a diagnosis. However, some symptoms ofCASare also symptoms of other types of speech or language disorders. It's hard to diagnoseCASif a child has only symptoms that are found both inCASand in other disorders. | Some characteristics, sometimes called markers, help distinguishCASfrom other types of speech disorders. Those associated withCASinclude: | Trouble moving smoothly from one sound, syllable or word to another. | Groping movements with the jaw, lips or tongue to try to make the correct movement for speech sounds. | Vowel distortions, such as trying to use the correct vowel but saying it incorrectly. | Using the wrong stress in a word, such as pronouncing ""banana"" as ""BUH-nan-uh"" instead of ""buh-NAN-uh."" | Using equal emphasis on all syllables, such as saying ""BUH-NAN-UH."" | Separation of syllables, such as putting a pause or gap between syllables. | Inconsistency, such as making different errors when trying to say the same word a second time. | Having a hard time imitating simple words. | Voicing errors, such as saying ""down"" instead of ""town.""",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/childhood-apraxia-of-speech/symptoms-causes/syc-20352045
Castleman disease,"Castleman disease is a group of rare disorders that involves lymph nodes that get bigger, called enlarged lymph nodes, and a wide range of symptoms. The most common form of the disorder involves a single enlarged lymph node. This lymph node is usually in the chest or neck, but it can occur in other areas of the body as well. This form of the disorder is called unicentric Castleman disease (UCD).
Multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) involves multiple regions of enlarged lymph nodes, inflammatory symptoms and problems with organ function. There are three types of MCD:
Sometimes, people may have 2-3 enlarged lymph nodes and mild symptoms that do not meet the diagnostic criteria for MCD. These people may have another disease, or they may have the recently described subtype of Castleman disease called oligocentric Castleman disease. This subtype is rare.
Treatment and outlook vary depending on the type of Castleman disease you have. Unicentric Castleman disease, which is the type that involves only one enlarged lymph node, can usually be successfully treated with surgery.
The best treatment for oligocentric Castleman disease, which involves a few enlarged lymph nodes and has limited symptoms, is not known but is thought to be similar to the treatment for unicentric Castleman disease.
While not all people with MCD respond to the first treatment, there are medicines that work to treat HHV-8-associated MCD and idiopathic MCD.",Many people with unicentric Castleman disease don't notice any signs or symptoms. The enlarged lymph node may be found during a physical exam or an imaging test for a different problem. | Some people with unicentric Castleman disease might have signs and symptoms that are more often seen in multicentric Castleman disease. These may include:,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/castleman-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20543017
Cataracts,"A cataract is a clouding of the lens of the eye, which is typically clear. For people who have cataracts, seeing through cloudy lenses is like looking through a frosty or fogged-up window. Clouded vision caused by cataracts can make it more difficult to read, drive a car at night or see the expression on a friend's face.
Most cataracts develop slowly and don't disturb eyesight early on. But with time, cataracts will eventually affect vision.
At first, stronger lighting and eyeglasses can help deal with cataracts. But if impaired vision affects usual activities, cataract surgery might be needed. Fortunately, cataract surgery is generally a safe, effective procedure.","Symptoms of cataracts include: | Clouded, blurred or dim vision. | Trouble seeing at night. | Sensitivity to light and glare. | Need for brighter light for reading and other activities. | Seeing ""halos"" around lights. | Frequent changes in eyeglass or contact lens prescription. | Fading or yellowing of colors. | Double vision in one eye. | At first, the cloudiness in your vision caused by a cataract may affect only a small part of the eye's lens. You may not notice any vision loss. As the cataract grows larger, it clouds more of your lens. More clouding changes the light passing through the lens. This may lead to symptoms you notice more.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cataracts/symptoms-causes/syc-20353790
Cavernous malformations,"Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are groups of tightly packed, irregular small blood vessels with thin walls. They may be present in the brain or spinal cord. The vessels contain slow-moving blood that's usually clotted. CCMs look like small mulberries. In some people, CCMs can cause blood to leak in the brain or spinal cord.
CCMs vary in size. Often they are less than half an inch (1 centimeter). Most CCMs are sporadic. This means the CCM occurs as a single cavernous malformation and there isn't a family history. But about 20% of CCMs affect people of the same family. These are known as familial CCMs. Familial CCMs are related to a gene change passed down through families. People with familial CCMs usually have multiple cavernous malformations.
A CCM is one of several types of brain vascular malformations that contain irregular blood vessels. Other types of vascular malformations include:
For people who have the sporadic form, it's common to have both a DVA and a CCM.
CCMs may leak blood and lead to bleeding in the brain or spinal cord, known as a hemorrhage. Brain hemorrhages can cause many symptoms, such as seizures.
Depending on the location, CCMs also can cause stroke-like symptoms such as trouble with movement or feeling in the legs and sometimes the arms. CCMs also may cause bowel and bladder symptoms.","Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) may not cause symptoms. Sometimes when the CCM occurs on the outer surface of the brain, it can cause seizures. | And CCMs found in other areas can have a variety of symptoms. These include CCMs in the spinal cord, the brainstem linking the spinal cord and brain, and the basal ganglia in the inner brain. For example, bleeding in the spinal cord may cause bowel and bladder symptoms or trouble with movement or feeling in the legs or arms. | Generally, symptoms of CCMs may include: | Seizures. | Bad headaches. | Weakness in the arms or legs. | Numbness. | Trouble speaking. | Poor memory and attention. | Trouble balancing and walking. | Vision changes, such as double vision. | Symptoms can get worse over time with repeated bleeding. Bleeding can happen again soon after the first bleed or much later. In some people, a repeat bleed may never occur.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cavernous-malformations/symptoms-causes/syc-20360941
Cavities and tooth decay,"Cavities are areas in the hard surface of your teeth that are damaged. These areas of tooth decay become tiny openings or holes that can lead to a serious toothache, infection and tooth loss. There are several causes of cavities, including bacteria in your mouth, snacking a lot, sipping sugary drinks and not cleaning your teeth well.
Cavities and tooth decay are among the world's most common health problems. They're especially common in children, teenagers and older adults. But anyone who has teeth can get cavities, including babies.
If cavities aren't treated, they get larger and affect deeper layers of your teeth. Regular dental visits and good brushing and flossing habits are the best ways to protect your teeth from cavities.","The symptoms of cavities vary, depending on how many you have and where they're located. When a cavity is just beginning, you may not have any symptoms. As the decay gets larger, it may cause symptoms such as: | Toothache and other pain. | Tooth sensitivity. | Mild to sharp pain when eating or drinking something sweet, hot or cold. | Holes or pits in your teeth that you can see. | Brown, black or white staining on any surface of a tooth. | Pain when you bite down.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cavities/symptoms-causes/syc-20352892
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH),"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a rare condition that happens in a baby before birth. It occurs early in pregnancy when a baby's diaphragm — the muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen — fails to close as it should. This leaves a hole in the diaphragm. The hole is called a hernia.
This hernia in the muscle of the diaphragm creates an opening between the abdomen and the chest. The intestines, stomach, liver and other abdominal organs may move through the hole into the baby's chest. If the intestines are in the chest, they don't develop the typical connections that hold them in place in the abdomen (malrotation). They may twist on themselves, cutting off their blood supply (volvulus).
In addition, the lung is small on the side of the diaphragm with the hernia, but the development of both lungs is affected. The air sacs (alveoli) inside the lungs don't develop as they should. This results in problems with blood flow and increased pressure inside the lung's blood vessels. The blood pressure in the lungs is higher than it should be, which can make it hard for the baby to breathe after birth. Some infants may also have problems with heart development.
Treatment ofCDHdepends on when the condition is found, how serious it is and whether there are problems with the heart.","Congenital diaphragmatic hernia ranges in severity. It may be mild and have few or no effects on the baby, or it can be more serious and affect the ability to bring oxygen to the rest of the body. | Babies born withCDHmay have: | Severe trouble breathing due to small lungs that don't work well (pulmonary hypoplasia). | A type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in the lungs and the right side of the heart (pulmonary hypertension). | Problems with development of the heart. | Damage to the intestines, stomach, liver and other abdominal organs if they move through the hernia into the chest.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia/symptoms-causes/syc-20544249
Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS),"Median arcuate ligament syndrome, also called MALS, happens when the band of tissue in the upper belly area presses on the artery that sends blood to the stomach, spleen and liver. This tissue is called the median arcuate ligament. The artery is called the celiac artery.
The median arcuate ligament creates a pathway between the chest and belly area for the body's main blood vessel, called the aorta. Typically, the ligament goes across the aorta. The celiac artery sits just below the arch.
But sometimes, the ligament or arteries may be out of place. The ligament may put pressure on the celiac artery and the network of surrounding nerves, called the celiac plexus. This pressure can cause the symptoms ofMALS. The condition can cause serious stomach pain in some people.
MALScan occur in anyone, even children. Other names forMALSare:
Treatment involves surgery to release pressure from the ligament on the artery and nerves.",Pressure on the celiac artery doesn't always cause symptoms.MALSsymptoms are mainly caused by pressure on the nerves. | Symptoms ofMALSinclude: | Stomach pain after eating or exercising. | The stomach pain gets better by leaning forward or backward or standing while eating. | Fear of eating food because of pain. | Unintended weight loss. | Bloating. | Diarrhea. | Nausea and vomiting.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/median-arcuate-ligament-syndrome-mals/symptoms-causes/syc-20505001
Celiac disease,"Celiac disease is an illness caused by an immune reaction to eating gluten. Gluten is a protein found in foods containing wheat, barley or rye.
If you have celiac disease, eating gluten triggers an immune response to the gluten protein in your small intestine. Over time, this reaction damages your small intestine's lining and prevents it from absorbing nutrients, a condition called malabsorption.
The intestinal damage often causes symptoms such as diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, bloating or anemia. It also can lead to serious complications if it is not managed or treated. In children, malabsorption can affect growth and development in addition to gastrointestinal symptoms.
There's no definite cure for celiac disease. But for most people, following a strict gluten-free diet can help manage symptoms and help the intestines heal.","The symptoms of celiac disease can vary greatly. They also may be different in children and adults. Digestive symptoms for adults include: | Diarrhea. | Fatigue. | Weight loss. | Bloating and gas. | Abdominal pain. | Nausea and vomiting. | Constipation. | However, more than half the adults with celiac disease have symptoms that are not related to the digestive system, including: | Anemia, usually from iron deficiency due to decreased iron absorption. | Loss of bone density, called osteoporosis, or softening of bones, called osteomalacia. | Itchy, blistery skin rash, called dermatitis herpetiformis. | Mouth ulcers. | Headaches and fatigue. | Nervous system injury, including numbness and tingling in the feet and hands, possible problems with balance, and cognitive impairment. | Joint pain. | Reduced functioning of the spleen, known as hyposplenism. | Elevated liver enzymes.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/celiac-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352220
Barrett's esophagus,"Barrett's esophagus is a condition in which the flat pink lining of the swallowing tube that connects the mouth to the stomach (esophagus) becomes damaged by acid reflux, which causes the lining to thicken and become red.
Between the esophagus and the stomach is a critically important valve, the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Over time, theLESmay begin to fail, leading to acid and chemical damage of the esophagus, a condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).GERDis often accompanied by symptoms such as heartburn or regurgitation. In some people, thisGERDmay trigger a change in the cells lining the lower esophagus, causing Barrett's esophagus.
Barrett's esophagus is associated with an increased risk of developing esophageal cancer. Although the risk of developing esophageal cancer is small, it's important to have regular checkups with careful imaging and extensive biopsies of the esophagus to check for precancerous cells (dysplasia). If precancerous cells are discovered, they can be treated to prevent esophageal cancer.","The development of Barrett's esophagus is most often attributed to long-standingGERD, which may include these signs and symptoms: | Frequent heartburn and regurgitation of stomach contents | Difficulty swallowing food | Less commonly, chest pain | Curiously, approximately half of the people diagnosed with Barrett's esophagus report little if any symptoms of acid reflux. So, you should discuss your digestive health with your doctor regarding the possibility of Barrett's esophagus.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/barretts-esophagus/symptoms-causes/syc-20352841
Cellulite,"Cellulite is a very common, harmless skin condition that causes lumpy, dimpled flesh on the thighs, hips, buttocks and abdomen. The condition is most prevalent in women.
Many people try, with variable success, to improve the appearance of their skin through weight loss, exercise, massage and creams marketed as a solution to cellulite. Medically proven treatment options are available as well, though results aren't immediate or long lasting.","Cellulite looks like dimpled or bumpy skin. It's sometimes described as having a cottage cheese or orange peel texture. | You can see mild cellulite only if you pinch your skin in an area where you have cellulite, such as your thighs. Cellulite that is more severe makes the skin appear rumpled and bumpy with areas of peaks and valleys. | Cellulite is most common around the thighs and buttocks, but it can also be found on the breasts, lower abdomen and upper arms.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cellulite/symptoms-causes/syc-20354945

Central sleep apnea,"Central sleep apnea is a disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep.
Central sleep apnea occurs because the brain doesn't send proper signals to the muscles that control breathing. This condition is different from obstructive sleep apnea, in which breathing stops because the throat muscles relax and block the airway. Central sleep apnea is less common than obstructive sleep apnea.
Central sleep apnea can result from other conditions, such as heart failure and stroke. Another possible cause is sleeping at a high altitude.
Treatments for central sleep apnea might involve managing existing conditions, using a device to assist breathing or using supplemental oxygen.","Common symptoms of central sleep apnea include: | Observed episodes of not breathing during sleep. | Sudden awakenings with shortness of breath. | Not being able to stay asleep, known as insomnia. | Excessive daytime sleepiness, known as hypersomnia. | Trouble focusing. | Mood changes. | Morning headaches. | Snoring. | Although snoring suggests some degree of a blocked airway, snoring also can occur in people with central sleep apnea. However, snoring may not be as prominent with central sleep apnea as it is with obstructive sleep apnea.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/central-sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20352109
Swimmer's itch,"Swimmer's itch is a rash that can occur after you go swimming or wading outdoors. It's most common after being in freshwater lakes and ponds, but you can get it in saltwater too.
Swimmer's itch is usually caused by a reaction to tiny parasites in the water that burrow into your skin while you're swimming or wading in warm, calm water. These parasites can't survive in people, so they soon die.
Swimmer's itch usually clears on its own within a few days. In the meantime, you can control itching with medicine.","Swimmer's itch symptoms include an itchy rash that looks like pimples or blisters. Symptoms may begin within minutes or as long as two days after swimming or wading in contaminated water. | Usually the rash affects skin that's not covered by swimsuits, wetsuits or waders. Your sensitivity to swimmer's itch can increase each time you're exposed to the parasites that cause it.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/swimmers-itch/symptoms-causes/syc-20355043
Brain aneurysm,"A brain aneurysm (AN-yoo-riz-um) — also known as a cerebral aneurysm or intracranial aneurysm — is a bulge or ballooning in a blood vessel in the brain. An aneurysm often looks like a berry hanging on a stem.
Experts think brain aneurysms form and grow because blood flowing through the blood vessel puts pressure on a weak area of the vessel wall. This can increase the size of the brain aneurysm. If the brain aneurysm leaks or ruptures, it causes bleeding in the brain, known as a hemorrhagic stroke.
Most often, a ruptured brain aneurysm occurs in the space between the brain and the thin tissues covering the brain. This type of hemorrhagic stroke is called a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Brain aneurysms are common. But most brain aneurysms aren't serious, especially if they're small. Most brain aneurysms don't rupture. They usually don't cause symptoms or cause health problems. In many cases, brain aneurysms are found during tests for other conditions.
However, a ruptured aneurysm quickly becomes life-threatening and requires medical treatment right away.
If a brain aneurysm hasn't ruptured, treatment may be appropriate in some cases. Treatment of an unruptured brain aneurysm may prevent a rupture in the future. Talk with your health care provider to make sure you understand the best options for your specific needs.","Most brain aneurysms that haven't ruptured don't cause symptoms. This is especially true if they're small. Brain aneurysms may be found during imaging tests that are done for other conditions. | However, a ruptured aneurysm is a very serious condition, typically causing a severe headache. And if an unruptured aneurysm presses against brain tissue or nerves, it may cause pain and other symptoms.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brain-aneurysm/symptoms-causes/syc-20361483
Cerebral palsy,"Cerebral palsy is a group of conditions that affect movement and posture. It's caused by damage that occurs to the developing brain, most often before birth.
Symptoms appear during infancy or preschool years and vary from very mild to serious. Children with cerebral palsy may have exaggerated reflexes. The arms, legs and trunk may appear floppy. Or they may have stiff muscles, known as spasticity. Symptoms also can include irregular posture, movements that can't be controlled, a walk that's not steady or some combination of these.
Cerebral palsy may make it hard to swallow. It also can cause eye muscle imbalance, in which the eyes don't focus on the same object. People with the condition might have reduced range of motion in their joints due to muscle stiffness.
The cause of cerebral palsy and its effect on function vary from person to person. Some people with cerebral palsy can walk while others need assistance. Some people have intellectual disabilities, but others do not. Epilepsy, blindness or deafness also might affect some people with cerebral palsy. There is no cure, but treatments can help improve function. The symptoms of cerebral palsy may vary during the child's development, but the condition doesn't get worse. The condition generally stays the same over time.","Symptoms of cerebral palsy can vary greatly. In some people, cerebral palsy affects the whole body. In other people, symptoms might only affect one or two limbs or one side of the body. General symptoms include trouble with movement and coordination, speech and eating, development, and other issues.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cerebral-palsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20353999
CSF leak (Cerebrospinal fluid leak),"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) surrounds the brain and spinal cord and provides a cushion to protect them from injury. There are three layers that surround the spinal cord and brain. When there is a hole or tear in the outermost layer, aCSFleak occurs. The hole or tear in this outer layer, called the dura mater, allows some of the fluid to escape.
There are two distinct types ofCSFleaks: spinalCSFleaks and cranialCSFleaks. Each type has different symptoms, causes and treatments.
A spinalCSFleak occurs anywhere in the spinal column. The most common symptom of a spinalCSFleak is a headache.
A cranialCSFleak occurs in the skull, and often causes symptoms such as clear fluid leaking from the nose or ear.
SomeCSFleaks may heal with bed rest and other conservative treatment. ManyCSFleaks need a patch to cover the hole or surgery to repair the leak.",Symptoms vary between spinal and cranialCSFleaks.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/csf-leak/symptoms-causes/syc-20522246
Stroke,"An ischemic stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is blocked or reduced. This prevents brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients. Brain cells begin to die in minutes. Another type of stroke is a hemorrhagic stroke. It occurs when a blood vessel in the brain leaks or bursts and causes bleeding in the brain. The blood increases pressure on brain cells and damages them.
A stroke is a medical emergency. It's crucial to get medical treatment right away. Getting emergency medical help quickly can reduce brain damage and other stroke complications.
The good news is that fewer Americans die of stroke now than in the past. Effective treatments also can help prevent disability from stroke.","If you or someone you're with may be having a stroke, pay attention to the time the symptoms began. Some treatments are most effective when given soon after a stroke begins. | Symptoms of stroke include: | Trouble speaking and understanding what others are saying.A person having a stroke may be confused, slur words or may not be able to understand speech. | Numbness, weakness or paralysis in the face, arm or leg.This often affects just one side of the body. The person can try to raise both arms over the head. If one arm begins to fall, it may be a sign of a stroke. Also, one side of the mouth may droop when trying to smile. | Problems seeing in one or both eyes.The person may suddenly have blurred or blackened vision in one or both eyes. Or the person may see double. | Headache.A sudden, severe headache may be a symptom of a stroke. Vomiting, dizziness and a change in consciousness may occur with the headache. | Trouble walking.Someone having a stroke may stumble or lose balance or coordination.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113

Incompetent cervix,"An incompetent cervix happens when weak cervical tissue causes or plays a part in a premature birth or the loss of a healthy pregnancy. An incompetent cervix also is called cervical insufficiency.
The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that opens to the vagina. Before pregnancy, it's usually closed and firm. As pregnancy goes on and you get ready to give birth, the cervix slowly changes. It softens, gets shorter and opens. If you have an incompetent cervix, it might begin to open too soon causing you to give birth too early.
An incompetent cervix can be a hard problem to diagnose and treat. If your cervix begins to open early, or if you've had cervical insufficiency in the past, you might benefit from treatment. This might include having a procedure done to close the cervix with strong sutures, called a cervical cerclage. You also may take medicine to help the incompetent cervix and have ultrasound exams to check how things are going.","With an incompetent cervix, there may be no signs or symptoms during early pregnancy. Some women have mild discomfort or spotting before the diagnosis. Often, this occurs before 24 weeks of pregnancy. | Be on the lookout for: | A feeling of pelvic pressure. | A new backache. | Mild stomach cramps. | A change in vaginal discharge. | Light vaginal bleeding.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/incompetent-cervix/symptoms-causes/syc-20373836

Neck pain,"Neck pain is common. Poor posture — whether from leaning over a computer or hunching over a workbench — strains neck muscles. Osteoarthritis also is a common cause of neck pain.
Rarely, neck pain can be a symptom of a more serious problem. Seek medical care for neck pain with numbness or loss of strength in the arms or hands or for pain that shoots into a shoulder or down an arm.","Symptoms include: | Pain that's often worsened by holding the head in one place for long periods, such as when driving or working at a computer | Muscle tightness and spasms | Decreased ability to move the head | Headache",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/neck-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20375581
Cervicitis,"Cervicitis is an inflammation of the cervix, the lower, narrow end of the uterus that opens into the vagina.
Possible symptoms of cervicitis include bleeding between menstrual periods, pain with intercourse or during a pelvic exam, and abnormal vaginal discharge. However, it's also possible to have cervicitis and not experience any signs or symptoms.
Often, cervicitis results from a sexually transmitted infection, such as chlamydia or gonorrhea. Cervicitis can develop from noninfectious causes, too. Successful treatment of cervicitis involves treating the underlying cause of the inflammation.","Most often, cervicitis causes no signs and symptoms, and you may only learn you have the condition after a pelvic exam performed by your doctor for another reason. If you do have signs and symptoms, they may include: | Large amounts of unusual vaginal discharge | Frequent, painful urination | Pain during sex | Bleeding between menstrual periods | Vaginal bleeding after sex, not associated with a menstrual period",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cervicitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20370814
Cystic fibrosis,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a condition passed down in families that causes damage to the lungs, digestive system and other organs in the body.
CF affects the cells that make mucus, sweat and digestive juices. These fluids, also called secretions, are usually thin and slippery to protect the body's internal tubes and ducts and make them smooth pathways. But in people with CF, a changed gene causes the secretions to become sticky and thick. The secretions plug up pathways, especially in the lungs and pancreas.
CF gets worse over time and needs daily care, but people with CF usually can attend school and work. They often have a better quality of life than people with CF had in past decades. Better screening and treatments mean that people with CF now may live into their mid- to late 50s or longer, and some are being diagnosed later in life.","In the U.S., because of newborn screening, cystic fibrosis can be diagnosed within the first month of life, before symptoms develop. But people born before newborn screening became available may not be diagnosed until the symptoms of CF show up. | CF symptoms vary, depending on which organs are affected and how severe the condition is. Even in the same person, symptoms may worsen or get better at different times. Some people may not have symptoms until their teenage years or adulthood. | People who are not diagnosed until adulthood usually have milder symptoms and are more likely to have symptoms that aren't typical. These may include repeated bouts of an inflamed pancreas called pancreatitis, infertility and repeated bouts of pneumonia. | People with CF have a higher than usual level of salt in their sweat. Parents often can taste the salt when they kiss their children. Most of the other symptoms of CF affect the respiratory system and digestive system.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cystic-fibrosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353700

Hip dysplasia,"Hip dysplasia is the medical term for a hip socket that doesn't fully cover the ball portion of the upper thighbone. This allows the hip joint to become partially or completely dislocated. Most people with hip dysplasia are born with the condition.
Healthcare professionals will check your baby for signs of hip dysplasia shortly after birth and during well-baby visits. If hip dysplasia is diagnosed in early infancy, a soft brace can usually correct the problem.
Mild hip dysplasia might not start causing symptoms until a person is a teenager or young adult. Hip dysplasia can damage the cartilage lining the joint. It also can hurt the soft cartilage, called the labrum, that rims the socket portion of the hip joint. This is called a hip labral tear.
In older children and young adults, surgery may be needed to move the bones into the proper positions for smooth joint movement.","Symptoms vary by age group. In infants, you might notice that one leg is longer than the other. Once a child begins walking, a limp may develop. During diaper changes, one hip may be less flexible than the other. | In teenagers and young adults, hip dysplasia can cause painful complications such as osteoarthritis or a hip labral tear. This may cause activity-related groin pain. Sometimes, there might be a sensation of instability in the hip.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hip-dysplasia/symptoms-causes/syc-20350209
Drug addiction (substance use disorder),"Drug addiction, also called substance use disorder, is a disease that affects a person's brain and behavior and leads to an inability to control the use of a legal or illegal drug or medicine. Substances such as alcohol, marijuana and nicotine also are considered drugs. When you're addicted, you may continue using the drug despite the harm it causes.
Drug addiction can start with experimental use of a recreational drug in social situations, and, for some people, the drug use becomes more frequent. For others, particularly with opioids, drug addiction begins when they take prescribed medicines or receive them from others who have prescriptions.
The risk of addiction and how fast you become addicted varies by drug. Some drugs, such as opioid painkillers, have a higher risk and cause addiction more quickly than others.
As time passes, you may need larger doses of the drug to get high. Soon you may need the drug just to feel good. As your drug use increases, you may find that it's increasingly difficult to go without the drug. Attempts to stop drug use may cause intense cravings and make you feel physically ill. These are called withdrawal symptoms.
Help from your health care provider, family, friends, support groups or an organized treatment program can help you overcome your drug addiction and stay drug-free.","Drug addiction symptoms or behaviors include, among others: | Feeling that you have to use the drug regularly — daily or even several times a day | Having intense urges for the drug that block out any other thoughts | Over time, needing more of the drug to get the same effect | Taking larger amounts of the drug over a longer period of time than you intended | Making certain that you maintain a supply of the drug | Spending money on the drug, even though you can't afford it | Not meeting obligations and work responsibilities, or cutting back on social or recreational activities because of drug use | Continuing to use the drug, even though you know it's causing problems in your life or causing you physical or psychological harm | Doing things to get the drug that you normally wouldn't do, such as stealing | Driving or doing other risky activities when you're under the influence of the drug | Spending a good deal of time getting the drug, using the drug or recovering from the effects of the drug | Failing in your attempts to stop using the drug | Experiencing withdrawal symptoms when you attempt to stop taking the drug",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/drug-addiction/symptoms-causes/syc-20365112
Chemo brain,"Chemo brain is a common term people with cancer use to describe trouble with thinking and memory that can happen during and after cancer treatment. Chemo brain also can be called chemo fog, cancer-related cognitive impairment or cognitive dysfunction.
Chemo brain is a widely used term because this condition was first reported in people having chemotherapy treatments. But experts don't fully know the causes of these concentration and memory changes. There's likely more than one cause.
No matter the cause, chemo brain can be a tough side effect of cancer and its treatment. Researchers are working to understand the memory changes that people with cancer have.","Chemo brain signs and symptoms include changes in memory and thinking. | Symptoms of chemo brain linked to memory may include: | Trouble recalling what you've said to others. | Trouble recalling what you've seen, such as images or lists of words. | Trouble recalling what's happened recently, called short-term memory issues. | Symptoms of chemo brain linked to thinking may include: | Trouble finding the right words. | Trouble learning new skills. | Trouble doing more than one thing at a time. | Mental fog. | Short attention span. | Taking longer than usual to do routine tasks.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chemo-brain/symptoms-causes/syc-20351060

Chiari malformation,"Chiari malformation (kee-AH-ree mal-for-MAY-shun) is a condition in which brain tissue extends into the spinal canal. It occurs when part of the skull is misshapen or smaller than is typical. The skull presses on the brain and forces it downward.
Chiari malformation is not common, but increased use of imaging tests has led to more diagnoses.
Health care professionals group Chiari malformation into three types. The type depends on the anatomy of the brain tissue that is pushed into the spinal canal. The type also depends on whether there are developmental changes of the brain or spine.
Chiari malformation type 1 develops as the skull and brain are growing. Symptoms may not occur until late childhood or adulthood. The pediatric forms of Chiari malformation are type 2 and type 3. These types are present at birth, which is known as congenital.
Treatment of Chiari malformation depends on the type and the symptoms. Regular monitoring, medicines and surgery are treatment options. Sometimes no treatment is needed.","Many people with Chiari malformation have no symptoms and don't need treatment. They learn they have Chiari malformation only when tests are performed for unrelated conditions. But some types of Chiari malfunction can cause symptoms. | The more common types of Chiari malformation are: | Type 1 | Type 2 | These types are less serious than the rarer pediatric form, type 3.

Chickenpox,"Chickenpox is an illness caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It brings on an itchy rash with small, fluid-filled blisters. Chickenpox spreads very easily to people who haven't had the disease or haven't gotten the chickenpox vaccine. Chickenpox used to be a widespread problem, but today the vaccine protects children from it.
The chickenpox vaccine is a safe way to prevent this illness and the other health problems that can happen during it.","The rash caused by chickenpox appears 10 to 21 days after you're exposed to the varicella-zoster virus. The rash often lasts about 5 to 10 days. Other symptoms that may appear 1 to 2 days before the rash include: | Fever. | Loss of appetite. | Headache. | Tiredness and a general feeling of being unwell. | Once the chickenpox rash appears, it goes through three phases: | Raised bumps called papules, which break out over a few days. | Small fluid-filled blisters called vesicles, which form in about one day and then break and leak. | Crusts and scabs, which cover the broken blisters and take a few more days to heal. | New bumps keep showing up for several days. So you may have bumps, blisters and scabs at the same time. You can spread the virus to other people for up to 48 hours before the rash appears. And the virus stays contagious until all broken blisters have crusted over. | The disease is by and large mild in healthy children. But sometimes, the rash can cover the whole body. Blisters may form in the throat and eyes. They also may form in tissue that lines the inside of the urethra, anus and vagina.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chickenpox/symptoms-causes/syc-20351282
Chilblains,"Chilblains (CHILL-blayns) is a condition that causes inflamed swollen patches and blistering on the hands and feet. It's caused by exposure to damp air that's cold but not freezing. Symptoms may show up a few hours after being in the cold.
Chilblains can be prevented by limiting your time in the cold, dressing warmly and covering exposed skin. If you do get chilblains, keeping the skin warm and dry can help ease the symptoms.
Chilblains, also known as perniosis, usually clears up in 2 or 3 weeks, especially if the weather gets warmer. You may get the symptoms each cold season for years.
The condition doesn't usually result in permanent injury.","Symptoms of chilblains include: | Small, itchy areas on your skin, often on your feet or hands. | Sores or blistering. | Swelling. | Pain or stinging. | Changes in skin color.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chilblains/symptoms-causes/syc-20351097

Childhood obesity,"Childhood obesity is a serious health condition that involves having excess body fat early in life. The extra weight often starts children on the path to other health conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Childhood obesity also can lead to poor self-esteem and depression.
The symptoms of childhood obesity aren't straightforward or simply based on how children look. And various factors can play a part in causing this condition. Some factors may be within a family's ability to change, such as eating and physical activity habits. Many other possible factors can't be changed, such those related to genes and hormones.
You can help manage or prevent childhood obesity by having your whole family regularly eat balanced meals and snacks. It also helps for the whole family to lead an active lifestyle. Steps such as these help protect your child's health now and in the future.","The symptoms of childhood obesity aren't clear-cut. Not all children who carry extra pounds are overweight. Some children have larger than average body frames. And it's typical for children to carry different amounts of body fat at the various stages of development. So you might not know if weight is a concern based on how your child looks. | A measurement called the body mass index (BMI) helps healthcare professionals check for overweight status and obese status. A child'sBMIis based on the child's weight and height compared with those of other children the same age and sex using growth charts. Speak with your child's healthcare professional about how your child'sBMIfits with other clues of children's health. For instance, growth patterns, eating and activity habits, stress, sleep, and family history also play a key role in health.

Childhood schizophrenia,"Childhood schizophrenia is an uncommon but severe mental disorder in which children and teenagers interpret reality abnormally. Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking (cognitive), behavior or emotions. It may result in some combination of hallucinations, delusions, and extremely disordered thinking and behavior that impairs your child's ability to function.
Childhood schizophrenia is essentially the same as schizophrenia in adults, but it starts early in life — generally in the teenage years — and has a profound impact on a child's behavior and development. With childhood schizophrenia, the early age of onset presents special challenges for diagnosis, treatment, education, and emotional and social development.
Schizophrenia is a chronic condition that requires lifelong treatment. Identifying and starting treatment for childhood schizophrenia as early as possible may significantly improve your child's long-term outcome.","Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking, behavior or emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. The effect can be disabling. | In most people with schizophrenia, symptoms generally start in the mid- to late 20s, though it can start later, up to the mid-30s. Schizophrenia is considered early onset when it starts before the age of 18. Onset of schizophrenia in children younger than age 13 is extremely rare. | Symptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with periods of worsening and remission of symptoms.

Chlamydia trachomatis,"Chlamydia (kluh-MID-e-uh) is a common sexually transmitted disease.
Sexually transmitted diseases are infections spread mainly by contact with genitals or bodily fluids. Also called STDs, STIs or venereal disease, sexually transmitted infections are caused by bacteria, viruses or parasites.
Chlamydia is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (truh-KOH-muh-tis) bacteria and spread through oral, vaginal or anal sex.
You might not know you have chlamydia because many people don't have symptoms, such as genital pain and discharge from the vagina or penis. Chlamydia trachomatis affects mostly young women, but it can occur in both men and women and in all age groups.
It's not difficult to treat, but if left untreated it can lead to more-serious health problems.","Early-stage Chlamydia trachomatis infections often cause few symptoms. Even when symptoms occur, they're often mild. That makes them easy to overlook, which is why regular screening is important. | Symptoms of Chlamydia trachomatis infection can include: | Painful urination. | Vaginal discharge. | Discharge from the penis. | Painful vaginal sex. | Vaginal bleeding between periods and after sex. | Testicular pain. | Depending on a person's sexual activity, Chlamydia trachomatis can infect the eyes, throat or rectum. | Eye infections, called conjunctivitis, cause the inside of the eyelid to be red and irritated.

Cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer),"Cholangiocarcinoma is a type of cancer that forms in the slender tubes (bile ducts) that carry the digestive fluid bile. Bile ducts connect your liver to your gallbladder and to your small intestine.
Cholangiocarcinoma, also known as bile duct cancer, occurs mostly in people older than age 50, though it can occur at any age.
Doctors divide cholangiocarcinoma into different types based on where the cancer occurs in the bile ducts:
Cholangiocarcinoma is often diagnosed when it's advanced, making successful treatment difficult to achieve.","Signs and symptoms of cholangiocarcinoma include: | Yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice) | Intensely itchy skin | White-colored stools | Fatigue | Abdominal pain on the right side, just below the ribs | Losing weight without trying | Fever | Night sweats | Dark urine",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cholangiocarcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352408
Primary sclerosing cholangitis,"Primary sclerosing (skluh-ROHS-ing) cholangitis (koh-lan-JIE-tis) is a disease of the bile ducts. Bile ducts carry the digestive liquid bile from your liver to your small intestine. In primary sclerosing cholangitis, inflammation causes scars within the bile ducts. These scars make the ducts hard and narrow and gradually cause serious liver damage. A majority of people with primary sclerosing cholangitis also have inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.
In most people with primary sclerosing cholangitis, the disease progresses slowly. It can eventually lead to liver failure, repeated infections, and tumors of the bile duct or liver. A liver transplant is the only known cure for advanced primary sclerosing cholangitis, but the disease may recur in the transplanted liver in a small number of patients.
Care for primary sclerosing cholangitis focuses on monitoring liver function, managing symptoms and, when possible, doing procedures that temporarily open blocked bile ducts.",Primary sclerosing cholangitis is often diagnosed before symptoms appear when a routine blood test or an X-ray taken for an unrelated condition shows liver abnormalities. | Early signs and symptoms often include: | Fatigue | Itching | Yellow eyes and skin (jaundice) | Abdominal pain | Many people diagnosed with primary sclerosing cholangitis before they have symptoms continue to feel generally well for several years. But there's no reliable way to predict how quickly or slowly the disease will progress for any individual. | Signs and symptoms that may appear as the disease progresses include: | Fever | Chills | Night sweats | Enlarged liver | Enlarged spleen | Weight loss,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355797
Cholecystitis,"Cholecystitis (ko-luh-sis-TIE-tis) is swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ on the right side of the belly under the liver. The gallbladder holds fluid that digests food. This fluid is called bile. The gallbladder releases bile into the small intestine.
Most often, gallstones that block the tube leading out of the gallbladder cause cholecystitis. This results in a bile buildup that can cause inflammation. Other causes of cholecystitis include bile duct changes, tumors, serious illness and certain infections.
If not treated, cholecystitis can lead to serious complications, such as gallbladder rupture. These can be life-threatening. Treatment for cholecystitis often involves surgery to remove the gallbladder.",Symptoms of cholecystitis may include: | Severe pain in the upper right or center belly area. | Pain that spreads to the right shoulder or back. | Tenderness over the belly area when it's touched. | Nausea. | Vomiting. | Fever. | Cholecystitis symptoms often come on after a meal. A large or fatty meal is most likely to cause symptoms.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cholecystitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20364867

Cholestasis of pregnancy,"Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, commonly known as cholestasis of pregnancy, is a liver condition that can occur in late pregnancy. The condition triggers intense itching, but without a rash. Itching is usually on the hands and feet but also can occur on other parts of the body.
Cholestasis of pregnancy can make you very uncomfortable. But more worrisome are the potential complications, especially for your baby. Because of the risk of complications, your pregnancy care provider may recommend early term delivery around 37 weeks.","Intense itching is the main symptom of cholestasis of pregnancy. But there is no rash. Typically, you feel itchy on the palms of your hands or the soles of your feet, but you may feel itchy everywhere. The itching is often worse at night and may bother you so much that you can't sleep. | The itching is most common during the third trimester of pregnancy but sometimes begins earlier. It may feel worse as your due date gets near. But once your baby arrives, the itchiness usually goes away within a few days. | Other less common signs and symptoms of cholestasis of pregnancy may include: | Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, called jaundice | Nausea | Loss of appetite | Oily, foul-smelling stools",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cholestasis-of-pregnancy/symptoms-causes/syc-20363257
Chondrosarcoma,"Chondrosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that usually begins in the bones, but can sometimes occur in the soft tissue near bones. Chondrosarcoma happens most often in the pelvis, hip and shoulder. More rarely, it can happen in the bones of the spine.
Most chondrosarcomas grow slowly and may not cause many signs and symptoms at first. Some rare types grow rapidly and have a high risk of spreading to other areas of the body, which can make these cancers difficult to treat.
Chondrosarcoma treatment usually involves surgery. Other options might include radiation therapy and chemotherapy.","Chondrosarcoma tends to grow slowly, so it might not cause signs and symptoms at first. When they occur, signs and symptoms of chondrosarcoma may include: | Increasing pain | A growing lump or area of swelling | Weakness or bowel and bladder control problems, if the cancer presses on the spinal cord",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chondrosarcoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20354196
Chordoma,"Chordoma is a rare type of bone cancer that starts as a growth of cells in the bones of the spine or the skull. It most often forms where the skull sits atop the spine, called the skull base, or at the bottom of the spine, called the sacrum.
Chordoma begins in cells that help form the spine before birth. The cells typically become the disks of the spine. If any of these cells are left over when a baby is born, they typically go away soon after birth. But sometimes a few of these cells stay and, rarely, they can become cancerous.
Chordoma usually grows slowly. It can be difficult to treat because a chordoma can grow very close to the spinal cord and other important structures, such as arteries, nerves or the brain. This cancer often comes back after treatment.","Signs and symptoms of chordoma may include: | Headache. | Neck pain. | Vision trouble, including blurred or double vision or vision loss. | Trouble with balance. | Hearing loss. | Facial paralysis. | Muscle weakness. | Trouble swallowing. | Shortness of breath.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chordoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20580258
Huntington's disease,"Huntington's disease causes nerve cells in the brain to decay over time. The disease affects a person's movements, thinking ability and mental health.
Huntington's disease is rare. It's often passed down through a changed gene from a parent.
Huntington's disease symptoms can develop at any time, but they often begin when people are in their 30s or 40s. If the disease develops before age 20, it's called juvenile Huntington's disease. When Huntington's develops early, symptoms can be different and the disease may have a faster progression.
Medicines are available to help manage the symptoms of Huntington's disease. However, treatments can't prevent the physical, mental and behavioral decline caused by the disease.",Huntington's disease usually causes movement disorders. It also causes mental health conditions and trouble with thinking and planning. These conditions can cause a wide spectrum of symptoms. The first symptoms vary greatly from person to person. Some symptoms appear to be worse or have a greater effect on functional ability.

Choroid plexus carcinoma,"Choroid plexus carcinoma is a rare type of brain cancer that happens mainly in children.
Choroid plexus carcinoma begins as a growth of cells in the part of the brain called the choroid plexus. Cells in the choroid plexus produce the fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord. This fluid is called cerebrospinal fluid, also known as CSF. As the cancer grows, it can cause too much CSF in the brain. This can lead to symptoms such as irritability, nausea or vomiting, and headaches.
Treatment and chance of recovery depend on many factors. These include the cancer's size, location, whether it has spread, and your child's age and general health.",Choroid plexus carcinoma symptoms include: | Blurred or double vision. | Headaches. | Increased tiredness. | Irritability. | Nausea. | Seizures. | Vomiting.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/choroid-plexus-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20578760
Addison's disease,"Addison's disease is a rare condition that happens when the body doesn't make enough of some hormones. Another name for Addison's disease is primary adrenal insufficiency. With Addison's disease, the adrenal glands make too little of the hormone cortisol. Often, they also make too little of another hormone called aldosterone.
Damage to the adrenal glands causes Addison's disease. Symptoms can start slowly. Early symptoms may include extreme tiredness, salt cravings and weight loss.
Addison's disease can affect anyone. Without treatment, it can be life-threatening. Treatment involves taking lab-made hormones to replace those that are missing.","Addison's disease symptoms usually happen slowly, often over months. The disease may happen so slowly that people who have it might ignore the symptoms at first. Physical stress such as an illness or injury can make symptoms get worse fast. | Early symptoms of Addison's disease can affect you in various ways. Some early symptoms can cause discomfort or loss of energy, including: | Extreme tiredness, also called fatigue. | Dizziness or fainting when standing after sitting or lying down. This is due to a type of low blood pressure called postural hypotension. | Sweating due to low blood sugar, also called hypoglycemia. | Upset stomach, diarrhea or vomiting. | Pain in the stomach area, also called the abdomen. | Muscle cramps, weakness, widespread pain or joint pain. | Other early symptoms can cause changes in how you look, such as: | Body hair loss. | Areas of darkened skin, especially on scars and moles.

Chronic cough,"A chronic cough is a cough that lasts eight weeks or longer in adults, or four weeks in children. A chronic cough is more than just annoying. It can interrupt your sleep and leave you feeling very tired. Severe cases of chronic cough can cause vomiting and lightheadedness, and even break a rib.
The most common causes are tobacco use and asthma. Other common causes include fluid that drips from the nose down the back of the throat, called postnasal drip, and the backward flow of stomach acid into the tube that connects the throat to the stomach, called acid reflux. Fortunately, chronic cough usually goes away once the underlying issue is treated.","A chronic cough can occur with other symptoms, including: | A runny or stuffy nose. | A feeling of liquid running down the back of your throat, also known as postnasal drip. | Clearing your throat a lot. | Sore throat. | Hoarseness. | Wheezing and shortness of breath. | Heartburn or a sour taste in your mouth. | In rare cases, coughing up blood.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-cough/symptoms-causes/syc-20351575
Chronic daily headaches,"Most people have headaches from time to time. But if you have a headache more days than not, you might have chronic daily headaches.
Rather than a specific headache type, chronic daily headaches include a variety of headache subtypes. Chronic refers to how often the headaches occur and how long the condition lasts.
The constant nature of chronic daily headaches makes them one of the most disabling headache conditions. Aggressive initial treatment and steady, long-term management might reduce pain and lead to fewer headaches.","By definition, chronic daily headaches occur 15 days or more a month, for longer than three months. True (primary) chronic daily headaches aren't caused by another condition. | There are short-lasting and long-lasting chronic daily headaches. Long-lasting headaches last more than four hours.

Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS),"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complicated disorder.
It causes extreme fatigue that lasts for at least six months. Symptoms worsen with physical or mental activity but don't fully improve with rest.
The cause ofME/CFSis unknown, although there are many theories. Experts believe it might be triggered by a combination of factors.
There's no single test to confirm a diagnosis. You may need a variety of medical tests to rule out other health problems that have similar symptoms. Treatment for the condition focuses on easing symptoms.","Symptoms ofME/CFScan vary from person to person, and the severity of symptoms can fluctuate from day to day. In addition to fatigue, symptoms may include: | Extreme exhaustion after physical or mental exercise. | Problems with memory or thinking skills. | Dizziness that worsens with moving from lying down or sitting to standing. | Muscle or joint pain. | Unrefreshing sleep. | Some people with this condition have headaches, sore throats, and tender lymph nodes in the neck or armpits.

Chronic granulomatous disease,"Chronic granulomatous (gran-u-LOM-uh-tus) disease (CGD) is an inherited disorder that occurs when a type of white blood cell, called a phagocyte, doesn't work properly. Phagocytes usually help your body fight infections. When they don't work as they should, phagocytes can't protect your body from bacterial and fungal infections.
People with chronic granulomatous disease may develop infections in their lungs, skin, lymph nodes, liver, stomach and intestines, or other areas. They also may develop clusters of white blood cells in infected areas. Most people are diagnosed withCGDduring childhood, but some people may not be diagnosed until adulthood.","People with chronic granulomatous disease experience serious bacterial or fungal infection every few years. An infection in the lungs, including pneumonia, is common. People withCGDmay develop a serious type of fungal pneumonia after being exposed to dead leaves, mulch or hay. | It's also common for people withCGDto experience infections of the skin, liver, stomach and intestines, brain, and eyes.

Chronic hives,"Hives — also called urticaria (ur-tih-KAR-e-uh) — is a skin reaction that causes itchy welts. Chronic hives are welts that last for more than six weeks and return often over months or years. Often, the cause of chronic hives isn't clear.
The welts often start as itchy patches that turn into swollen welts that vary in size. These welts appear and fade at random as the reaction runs its course. Each individual welt typically lasts less than 24 hours.
Chronic hives can be very uncomfortable and interfere with sleep and daily activities. For many people, anti-itch medicines, called antihistamines, provide relief.","Symptoms of chronic hives include: | Batches of welts, called weals, that can arise anywhere on the body. | Welts that might be red, purple or skin-colored, depending on your skin color. | Welts that vary in size, change shape, and appear and fade repeatedly. | Itchiness, also called pruritus, which can be intense. | Painful swelling, called angioedema, around the eyes, cheeks or lips. | Flares triggered by heat, exercise or stress. | Symptoms that persist for more than six weeks and recur often and anytime, sometimes for months or years.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-hives/symptoms-causes/syc-20352719
Chronic kidney disease,"Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, involves a gradual loss of kidney function. Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then removed in your urine. Advanced chronic kidney disease can cause dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes to build up in your body.
In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you might have few signs or symptoms. You might not realize that you have kidney disease until the condition is advanced.
Treatment for chronic kidney disease focuses on slowing the progression of kidney damage, usually by controlling the cause. But, even controlling the cause might not keep kidney damage from progressing. Chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal without artificial filtering (dialysis) or a kidney transplant.","Signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease develop over time if kidney damage progresses slowly. Loss of kidney function can cause a buildup of fluid or body waste or electrolyte problems. Depending on how severe it is, loss of kidney function can cause: | Nausea | Vomiting | Loss of appetite | Fatigue and weakness | Sleep problems | Urinating more or less | Decreased mental sharpness | Muscle cramps | Swelling of feet and ankles | Dry, itchy skin | High blood pressure (hypertension) that's difficult to control | Shortness of breath, if fluid builds up in the lungs | Chest pain, if fluid builds up around the lining of the heart | Signs and symptoms of kidney disease are often nonspecific. This means they can also be caused by other illnesses. Because your kidneys are able to make up for lost function, you might not develop signs and symptoms until irreversible damage has occurred.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354521
Hashimoto's disease,,,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hashimotos-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20351855
COPD,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an ongoing lung condition caused by damage to the lungs. The damage results in swelling and irritation, also called inflammation, inside the airways that limit airflow into and out of the lungs. This limited airflow is known as obstruction. Symptoms include trouble breathing, a daily cough that brings up mucus and a tight, whistling sound in the lungs called wheezing.
COPD is most often caused by long-term exposure to irritating smoke, fumes, dust or chemicals. The most common cause is cigarette smoke.
Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the two most common types of COPD. These two conditions usually occur together and can vary in severity among people with COPD.
Chronic bronchitis is inflammation of the lining of the tubes that bring air into the lungs. These tubes are called bronchi. The inflammation prevents good airflow into and out of the lungs and makes extra mucus. In emphysema, the small air sacs of the lungs, called alveoli, are damaged. The damaged alveoli can't pass enough oxygen into the bloodstream.
Although COPD is a condition that can get worse over time, COPD is treatable. With proper management, most people with COPD can control symptoms and improve their quality of life. Proper management also can lower the risk of other conditions linked to COPD, such as heart disease and lung cancer.","COPD symptoms often don't appear until a lot of lung damage has occurred. Symptoms usually worsen over time, especially if smoking or other irritating exposure continues. | Symptoms of COPD may include: | Trouble catching your breath, especially during physical activities. | Wheezing or whistling sounds when breathing. | Ongoing cough that may bring up a lot of mucus. The mucus may be clear, white, yellow or greenish. | Chest tightness or heaviness. | Lack of energy or feeling very tired. | Frequent lung infections. | Losing weight without meaning to. This may happen as the condition worsens. | Swelling in ankles, feet or legs. | People with COPD also are likely to have times when their symptoms become worse than the usual day-to-day variation. This time of worsening symptoms is called an exacerbation (eg-zas-er-bay-shun). Exacerbations can last for several days to weeks. They can be caused by triggers such as smells, cold air, air pollution, colds or infections. Symptoms may include: | Working harder than usual to breathe or having trouble breathing. | Chest tightness. | Coughing more often. | More mucus or changes in mucus color or thickness. | Fever.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/copd/symptoms-causes/syc-20353679
Chronic pelvic pain,"Chronic pelvic pain is pain in the area below the bellybutton and between the hips that lasts six months or longer.
Chronic pelvic pain can have more than one cause. It may be a symptom of another disease, or it can be a condition in its own right.
If chronic pelvic pain seems to be caused by another health condition, treating that problem may get rid of the pain.
But tests may not be able to find a cause for chronic pelvic pain. In that case, the goal of treatment is to ease pain and other symptoms. That could make your quality of life better.","You may feel chronic pelvic pain in different parts of your pelvic area, rather than in just one spot. You might describe the pain in one or more of the following ways: | Serious and steady. | Pain that comes and goes. | Dull aching. | Sharp pains or cramping. | Pressure or heaviness deep within the pelvis. | The pain also may happen: | During sex. | While having a bowel movement or urinating. | When you sit or stand for a long time. | Chronic pelvic pain may be mild.

Chronic sinusitis,"Chronic sinusitis causes the spaces inside the nose and head, called sinuses, to become inflamed and swollen. The condition lasts 12 weeks or longer, even with treatment.
This common condition keeps mucus from draining. It makes the nose stuffy. Breathing through the nose might be hard. The area around the eyes might feel swollen or tender.
Infection, growths in the sinuses, called nasal polyps, and swelling of the lining of the sinuses might all be part of chronic sinusitis. Chronic sinusitis is also called chronic rhinosinusitis. The condition affects adults and children.","Common symptoms of chronic sinusitis include: | Thick, discolored mucus from the nose, known as a runny nose. | Mucus down the back of the throat, known as postnasal drip. | Blocked or stuffy nose, known as congestion. This makes it hard to breathe through the nose. | Pain, tenderness and swelling around the eyes, cheeks, nose or forehead. | Reduced sense of smell and taste. | Other symptoms can include: | Ear pain. | Headache. | Aching in the teeth. | Cough. | Sore throat. | Bad breath. | Tiredness. | Chronic sinusitis and acute sinusitis have similar symptoms. But acute sinusitis is a short-lived infection of the sinuses often linked to a cold. | The symptoms of chronic sinusitis last at least 12 weeks. There might be many bouts of acute sinusitis before it becomes chronic sinusitis. Fever isn't common with chronic sinusitis. But fever might be part of acute sinusitis.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-sinusitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351661
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a brain disorder likely caused by repeated head injuries. It causes the death of nerve cells in the brain, known as degeneration.CTEgets worse over time. The only way to definitively diagnosisCTEis after death during an autopsy of the brain.
CTEis a rare disorder that is not yet well understood.CTEdoesn't appear to be related to a single head injury. It's related to repeated head injuries, often occurring in contact sports or military combat. The development ofCTEhas been associated with second impact syndrome, in which a second head injury happens before previous head injury symptoms have fully resolved.
Experts are still trying to understand how repeated head injuries and other factors might contribute to the changes in the brain that result inCTE. Researchers are looking into how the number of head injuries someone experiences and how bad the injuries are may affect risk ofCTE.
CTEhas been found in the brains of people who played U.S. football and other contact sports, including boxing. It also may occur in military members who were exposed to explosive blasts. Symptoms ofCTEare thought to include trouble with thinking and emotions, physical problems, and other behaviors. It's thought that these develop years to decades after head trauma occurs.
CTEcan't be definitively diagnosed during life except in people with high-risk exposures. Researchers are currently developing diagnostic biomarkers forCTE, but none has been validated yet. When the symptoms associated withCTEoccur, health care providers may diagnose traumatic encephalopathy syndrome.
Experts don't yet know how oftenCTEoccurs in the population, but it appears to be rare. They also don't fully understand the causes. There is no cure forCTE.","There are no specific symptoms that have been clearly linked toCTE. Some of the possible symptoms can occur in many other conditions.

Cirrhosis,"Cirrhosis is advanced scarring of the liver caused by many diseases and conditions, including hepatitis or alcohol use disorder.
Each time the liver is injured — whether by alcohol use disorder or another cause, such as infection — it tries to repair itself. In the process, scar tissue forms. As cirrhosis gets worse, more and more scar tissue forms, making it difficult for the liver to do its job. Advanced cirrhosis is life-threatening.
The liver damage caused by cirrhosis generally can't be undone. But if liver cirrhosis is diagnosed early and the underlying cause is treated, further damage can be limited. In rare cases, it may be reversed.","Cirrhosis often has no symptoms until liver damage is serious. When symptoms do happen, they may include: | Extreme tiredness. | Easily bleeding or bruising. | Loss of appetite. | Nausea. | Swelling in the legs, feet or ankles, called edema. | Weight loss. | Itchy skin. | Yellow discoloration in the skin and eyes, called jaundice. | Fluid buildup in the belly, called ascites (uh-SAHY-teez). | Spiderlike blood vessels on the skin. | Redness in the palms of the hands. | Pale fingernails, especially the thumb and index finger. | Clubbing of the fingers, in which the fingertips spread out and become rounder than usual. | For women, absence of or loss of periods not related to menopause. | For men, loss of sex drive, testicular shrinkage or breast enlargement, known as gynecomastia. | Confusion, drowsiness or slurred speech.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cirrhosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351487

Cleft lip and cleft palate,"Cleft lip and cleft palate are openings or splits in the upper lip, the roof of the mouth (palate) or both. Cleft lip and cleft palate occur when an unborn baby's face and mouth are developing and the upper lip and palate don't close fully.
Cleft lip and cleft palate are among the most common birth defects. These birth defects can occur on their own or together. Sometimes a syndrome may cause these birth defects. But the cause is often not known.
Having a baby born with a cleft can be upsetting, but treatment can correct cleft lip and cleft palate. After a series of surgeries, the lips and palate work like they should and the baby looks much better. Usually, only slight scarring occurs.","Usually, a split (cleft) in the lip or roof of the mouth (palate) can be seen right away at birth. It may be found before birth during a prenatal ultrasound. Cleft lip and cleft palate may look like: | A split in the lip and palate that affects one or both sides of the face. | A split in the lip that appears as only a small notch in the lip or extends from the lip through the upper gum and palate into the bottom of the nose. | A split in the roof of the mouth that doesn't affect how the face looks. | Less often, a cleft occurs only in the muscles of the soft palate, which are at the back of the mouth and covered by the mouth's lining. This is called a submucous cleft palate. This type of cleft may not be seen at birth and may not be diagnosed until later when signs arise, such as: | Having a hard time feeding. | Nasal speaking voice. | Constant ear infections. | Rarely, having a hard time swallowing.

Depression (major depressive disorder),"Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. Also called major depressive disorder or clinical depression, it affects how you feel, think and behave and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. You may have trouble doing normal day-to-day activities, and sometimes you may feel as if life isn't worth living.
More than just a bout of the blues, depression isn't a weakness and you can't simply ""snap out"" of it. Depression may require long-term treatment. But don't get discouraged. Most people with depression feel better with medication, psychotherapy or both.","Although depression may occur only once during your life, people typically have multiple episodes.

Clubfoot,"Clubfoot describes a condition present at birth in which a baby's foot is pointed in and down. The tissues connecting the muscles to the bone are called tendons. In clubfoot, the tendons are shorter than usual, pulling the foot out of position.
Also called congenital talipes equinovarus (TAL-ih-peez e-kwie-no-VAY-rus), clubfoot is a common foot condition. It can occur in up to 1 in 1,000 babies. Most newborns with clubfoot do not have other medical conditions.
Clubfoot can be mild to severe. About half of children with clubfoot have it in both feet. If a child has clubfoot that is not treated, the child may walk on the side or top of the foot. This can cause a limp, skin sores or calluses, and problems wearing shoes.
Clubfoot will not get better without treatment. But it can be successfully treated using a specific casting technique. Usually, babies also need a minor procedure to lengthen the heel tendon. Treatment results are best with casting that begins within several weeks after birth.","If your child has clubfoot, here's what it might look like: | The top of the foot is usually pointed in and down. This raises the arch and turns the heel inward. | The foot may be turned so severely that it looks like it is upside down. | The foot or big toe may be slightly shorter than the other foot. | The calf muscles in the leg with clubfoot are usually smaller. | At birth, clubfoot doesn't cause any discomfort or pain.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/clubfoot/symptoms-causes/syc-20350860

Coarctation of the aorta,"Aortic coarctation (ko-ahrk-TAY-shun) is a narrowing of a part of the body's main artery, called the aorta. The condition forces the heart to work harder to pump blood.
Coarctation of the aorta is usually present at birth. That means it is a congenital heart defect. But sometimes the condition can occur later in life.
Coarctation of the aorta often occurs along with other congenital heart defects. Treatment to fix the condition is usually successful. But regular health checkups are needed for life to watch for changes in the heart's health.","Symptoms of coarctation of the aorta depend on how much of the aorta is narrowed. Most people don't have symptoms. | Adults and older children with mild coarctation of the aorta may not have symptoms and their hearts may seem healthy. | If a baby is born with an extreme narrowing of the aorta, symptoms may be noticed shortly after birth. Symptoms of coarctation of the aorta in infants include: | Difficulty breathing. | Difficulty feeding. | Heavy sweating. | Irritability. | Changes in skin color. | Symptoms of coarctation of the aorta later in life may include: | Chest pain. | High blood pressure. | Headaches. | Muscle weakness. | Leg cramps. | Cold feet. | Nosebleeds. | Coarctation of the aorta often occurs with other heart conditions present at birth.

Hypothermia,"Hypothermia is a condition that occurs when core body temperature drops below 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius). It is a medical emergency. In hypothermia (hi-poe-THUR-me-uh), the body loses heat faster than it can produce heat, causing a dangerously low body temperature. Regular body temperature is around 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius).
When body temperature drops, the heart, nervous system and other organs can't work as well as they usually do. Left untreated, hypothermia can cause the heart and respiratory system to fail and eventually can lead to death.
Common causes of hypothermia include exposure to cold weather or immersion in cold water. Treatment for hypothermia includes methods to warm the body back to a regular temperature.","When the temperature starts to drop, the body can start to shiver. Shivering is the body's attempt to warm itself. It is an automatic defense against cold temperature. | Symptoms of hypothermia include: | Shivering. | Slurred speech or mumbling. | Slow, shallow breathing. | Weak pulse. | Clumsiness or lack of coordination. | Drowsiness or very low energy. | Confusion or memory loss. | Loss of consciousness. | In infants, bright red, cold skin. | People with hypothermia usually aren't aware of their condition. The symptoms often begin gradually. Also, the confused thinking associated with hypothermia prevents self-awareness. The confused thinking also can lead to risk-taking behavior.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypothermia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352682
Cold sore,"Cold sores, or fever blisters, are a common viral infection. They are tiny, fluid-filled blisters on and around the lips. These blisters are often grouped together in patches. After the blisters break, a scab forms that can last several days. Cold sores usually heal in 2 to 3 weeks without leaving a scar.
Cold sores spread from person to person by close contact, such as kissing. They're usually caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), and less commonly herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). Both of these viruses can affect the mouth or genitals and can be spread by oral sex. The virus can spread even if you don't see the sores.
There's no cure for cold sores, but treatment can help manage outbreaks. Prescription antiviral medicine or creams can help sores heal more quickly. And they may make future outbreaks happen less often and be shorter and less serious.","A cold sore usually passes through several stages: | Tingling and itching.Many people feel itching, burning or tingling around the lips for a day or so before a small, hard, painful spot appears and blisters form. | Blisters.Small fluid-filled blisters often form along the border of the lips. Sometimes they appear around the nose or cheeks or inside the mouth. | Oozing and crusting.The small blisters may merge and then burst. This can leave shallow open sores that ooze and crust over. | Symptoms vary, depending on whether this is your first outbreak or a recurrence. The first time you have a cold sore, symptoms may not start for up to 20 days after you were first exposed to the virus. The sores can last several days. And the blisters can take 2 to 3 weeks to heal completely. If blisters return, they'll often appear at the same spot each time and tend to be less severe than the first outbreak. | In a first-time outbreak, you also might experience: | Fever. | Painful gums. | Sore throat. | Headache. | Muscle aches. | Swollen lymph nodes. | Children under 5 years old may have cold sores inside their mouths. These sores are often mistaken for canker sores. Canker sores involve only the mucous membrane and aren't caused by the herpes simplex virus.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cold-sore/symptoms-causes/syc-20371017
Common cold,"The common cold is an illness affecting your nose and throat. Most often, it's harmless, but it might not feel that way. Germs called viruses cause a common cold.
Often, adults may have two or three colds each year. Infants and young children may have colds more often.
Most people recover from a common cold in 7 to 10 days. Symptoms might last longer in people who smoke. Most often, you don't need medical care for a common cold. If symptoms don't get better or if they get worse, see your health care provider.
Illnesses of the nose and throat caused by germs are called upper respiratory tract infections.","Most often, common cold symptoms start 1 to 3 days after someone is exposed to a cold virus. Symptoms vary. They can include: | Runny or stuffy nose. | Sore or scratchy throat. | Cough. | Sneezing. | Generally feeling unwell. | Slight body aches or a mild headache. | Low-grade fever. | The mucus from your nose may start out clear and become thicker and yellow or green.

Colic,,,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colic/symptoms-causes/syc-20371074
Ischemic colitis,"Ischemic colitis happens when blood flow to part of the large intestine, called the colon, is temporarily reduced. When blood flow slows down, cells in the colon don't get enough oxygen, which may result in damage and swelling of the colon's tissues. Causes of reduced blood flow may include narrowing of the blood vessels supplying the colon or low blood pressure. Ischemic colitis is also called colonic ischemia.
Any part of the colon can be affected, but ischemic colitis most commonly causes pain on the left side of the belly area.
Ischemic colitis can be hard to diagnose because it can easily be confused with other digestive problems. You may need medicine to treat ischemic colitis or prevent infection. Or you may need surgery if your colon has been damaged. Most often, however, ischemic colitis heals on its own.","Symptoms of ischemic colitis can include: | Pain, tenderness or cramping in the belly, which can happen suddenly or happen over time. | Bright red or maroon blood in the stool or, at times, passage of blood alone without stool. | A feeling of urgency to move the bowels. | Diarrhea. | Nausea. | The risk of serious complications is higher when symptoms happen on the right side of the belly. This is less commonly seen compared with left-sided colitis. People with right-sided colitis tend to have more underlying medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation and kidney disease. They more often have to undergo surgery and also have a higher risk of death.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ischemic-colitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20374001
Microscopic colitis,"Microscopic colitis is swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of the large intestine. This large intestine is also called the colon. Microscopic colitis causes symptoms of watery diarrhea.
The condition gets its name from needing to look at colon tissue under a microscope to diagnose it. The tissue appears typical on exam with a colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy.
There are two subtypes of microscopic colitis:
Researchers believe collagenous (kuh-LAYJ-uh-nus) colitis and lymphocytic colitis may be forms of the same condition. Symptoms, testing and treatment are the same for both subtypes.","Symptoms of microscopic colitis include: | Watery diarrhea. | Belly pain, cramps or bloating. | Weight loss. | Nausea. | Not being able to control bowel movements, called fecal incontinence. | The body not having enough water, called dehydration. | The symptoms of microscopic colitis can come and go. At times, symptoms improve on their own.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/microscopic-colitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351478
Ulcerative colitis,"Ulcerative colitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes inflammation and sores, called ulcers, in part of the digestive tract. Ulcerative colitis (UL-sur-uh-tiv koe-LIE-tis) affects the innermost lining of the large intestine, called the colon, and rectum. Symptoms usually develop over time, rather than coming on suddenly.
Ulcerative colitis can weaken the body and can sometimes lead to life-threatening complications. While it has no known cure, treatment can greatly reduce and relieve symptoms of the disease. It also may bring about long-term remission.","Ulcerative colitis symptoms can vary, depending on how serious the inflammation is and where it happens. Symptoms may include: | Diarrhea, often with blood or pus. | Rectal bleeding — passing a small amount of blood with stool. | Belly pain and cramping. | Rectal pain. | Urgency to pass stool. | Not being able to pass stool despite urgency. | Weight loss. | Fatigue. | Fever. | In children, failure to grow. | About half of the people with ulcerative colitis have mild to moderate symptoms. The course of ulcerative colitis may vary, with some people having long periods of remission.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ulcerative-colitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353326
Pneumothorax,"A pneumothorax (noo-moe-THOR-aks) is a collapsed lung. A pneumothorax occurs when air leaks into the space between your lung and chest wall. This air pushes on the outside of your lung and makes it collapse. A pneumothorax can be a complete lung collapse or a collapse of only a portion of the lung.
A pneumothorax can be caused by a blunt or penetrating chest injury, certain medical procedures, or damage from underlying lung disease. Or it may occur for no obvious reason. Symptoms usually include sudden chest pain and shortness of breath. On some occasions, a collapsed lung can be a life-threatening event.
Treatment for a pneumothorax usually involves inserting a needle or chest tube between the ribs to remove the excess air. However, a small pneumothorax may heal on its own.",The main symptoms of a pneumothorax are sudden chest pain and shortness of breath. Severity of symptoms may depend on how much of the lung is collapsed.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumothorax/symptoms-causes/syc-20350367
Atelectasis,"Atelectasis (at-uh-LEK-tuh-sis) is the collapse of a lung or part of a lung, also known as a lobe. It happens when tiny air sacs within the lung, called alveoli, lose air.
Atelectasis is one of the most common breathing complications after surgery. It's also a possible complication of other respiratory problems, including cystic fibrosis, lung tumors, chest injuries, fluid in the lung and respiratory weakness. You may develop atelectasis if you breathe in a foreign object.
This condition can make breathing hard, particularly if you already have lung disease. Treatment depends on what's causing the collapse and how severe it is.
The definition of atelectasis is broader than pneumothorax (noo-moe-THOR-aks). Pneumothorax is when air leaks into the space between your lungs and chest wall, causing part or all of a lung to collapse. Pneumothorax is one of several causes of atelectasis.","There may be no clear signs of atelectasis. If you have any signs, they may include: | Having a hard time breathing. | Rapid, weak breathing. | Wheezing. | Coughing.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atelectasis/symptoms-causes/syc-20369684
Colon polyps,"A colon polyp is a small clump of cells that forms on the lining of the colon. Most colon polyps are harmless. But over time, some colon polyps can develop into colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer can be deadly when found in its later stages.
Anyone can develop colon polyps, and your risk increases as you age. Your risk for colorectal cancer also is higher if you are overweight, smoke, have a personal history of colon polyps, or a family history of advanced colon polyps or colorectal cancer.
Colon polyps don't usually cause symptoms. It's important to have regular screening tests because colon polyps found early can usually be removed safely and completely. The best prevention for colorectal cancer is regular screening.","Most people with colon polyps do not have any symptoms. Colon polyps are often found as a part of routine colorectal cancer screening. | Symptoms that should prompt an appointment with a healthcare professional include: | Change in bowel habits.Constipation or diarrhea that lasts longer than a week may mean the presence of a larger colon polyp or cancer. However, several other conditions also can cause changes in bowel habits. | Change in stool color.Blood can show up as red streaks in the stool or make stool appear black. A change in color also may be caused by certain foods, medicines or dietary supplements. | Iron deficiency anemia.Bleeding from polyps can happen slowly over time, without visible blood in the stool. Chronic bleeding may lead to iron deficiency anemia, which can cause tiredness and shortness of breath. | Pain.A large colon polyp or cancer can block part of the bowel, leading to cramping and belly pain. | Rectal bleeding.This can be a sign of colon polyps or cancer or other conditions, such as hemorrhoids or minor tears of the anus.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-polyps/symptoms-causes/syc-20352875
Color blindness,"Color blindness is an eye condition in which someone can't see the difference between certain colors. Though many people commonly use the term ""color blind"" for this condition, true color blindness — in which everything is seen in shades of black and white — is rare. The medical term for color blindness is known as color vision deficiency.
Color blindness is usually inherited, meaning it's passed down through families. Men are more likely to be born with color blindness. Most people with color blindness can't tell the difference between certain shades of red and green. Less commonly, people with color blindness can't tell the difference between shades of blue and yellow.
Certain eye diseases and some medicines also can cause color blindness.","You may have a color vision deficiency and not know it. Some people figure out that they or their child has the condition when it causes confusion — such as when there are problems differentiating the colors in a traffic light or interpreting color-coded learning materials. | People affected by color blindness may not be able to distinguish: | Different shades of red and green. | Different shades of blue and yellow. | Any colors. | The most common color deficiency is an inability to see some shades of red and green. Often, a person who is red-green or blue-yellow deficient isn't completely insensitive to both colors. Defects can be mild, moderate or severe.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/color-blindness/symptoms-causes/syc-20354988
Coma,"Coma is a state of prolonged loss of consciousness. It can have a variety of causes, including traumatic head injury, stroke, brain tumor, or drug or alcohol intoxication. A coma may even be caused by an underlying illness, such as diabetes or an infection.
Coma is a medical emergency. Quick action is needed to preserve life and brain function. Healthcare professionals typically order a series of blood tests and a brain scan to try to learn what's causing the coma so that proper treatment can begin.
A coma doesn't usually last longer than several weeks. People who are unconscious for a longer time might transition to a lasting vegetative state, known as a persistent vegetative state, or brain death.","The symptoms of a coma commonly include: | Closed eyes. | Depressed brainstem reflexes, such as pupils not responding to light. | No responses of limbs except for reflex movements. | No response to painful stimuli except for reflex movements. | Irregular breathing.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coma/symptoms-causes/syc-20371099

Common warts are caused by a virus and are transmitted by touch. It can take 2 to 6 months for a wart to develop. The warts are usually harmless and over time go away on their own. But many people choose to remove them because they find them bothersome or embarrassing.","Common warts symptoms include: | Small, fleshy, grainy bumps on the fingers or hands. | Feeling rough to the touch. | A sprinkling of black dots, which are clotted blood vessels.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-warts/symptoms-causes/syc-20371125

Complicated grief,"Losing a loved one is one of the most distressing and, unfortunately, common experiences people face. Most people experiencing normal grief and bereavement have a period of sorrow, numbness, and even guilt and anger. Gradually these feelings ease, and it's possible to accept loss and move forward.
For some people, feelings of loss are debilitating and don't improve even after time passes. This is known as complicated grief, sometimes called persistent complex bereavement disorder. In complicated grief, painful emotions are so long lasting and severe that you have trouble recovering from the loss and resuming your own life.
Different people follow different paths through the grieving experience. The order and timing of these phases may vary from person to person:
These differences are normal. But if you're unable to move through these stages more than a year after the death of a loved one, you may have complicated grief. If so, seek treatment. It can help you come to terms with your loss and reclaim a sense of acceptance and peace.","During the first few months after a loss, many signs and symptoms of normal grief are the same as those of complicated grief. However, while normal grief symptoms gradually start to fade over time, those of complicated grief linger or get worse. Complicated grief is like being in an ongoing, heightened state of mourning that keeps you from healing. | Signs and symptoms of complicated grief may include: | Intense sorrow, pain and rumination over the loss of your loved one | Focus on little else but your loved one's death | Extreme focus on reminders of the loved one or excessive avoidance of reminders | Intense and persistent longing or pining for the deceased | Problems accepting the death | Numbness or detachment | Bitterness about your loss | Feeling that life holds no meaning or purpose | Lack of trust in others | Inability to enjoy life or think back on positive experiences with your loved one | Complicated grief also may be indicated if you continue to: | Have trouble carrying out normal routines | Isolate from others and withdraw from social activities | Experience depression, deep sadness, guilt or self-blame | Believe that you did something wrong or could have prevented the death | Feel life isn't worth living without your loved one | Wish you had died along with your loved one",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/complicated-grief/symptoms-causes/syc-20360374

Hoarding disorder,"Hoarding disorder is an ongoing difficulty throwing away or parting with possessions because you believe that you need to save them. You may experience distress at the thought of getting rid of the items. You gradually keep or gather a huge number of items, regardless of their actual value.
Hoarding often creates extremely cramped living conditions with only narrow pathways winding through stacks of clutter. Countertops, sinks, stoves, desks, stairways and all other surfaces are usually piled with stuff. You may not be able to use some areas for their intended purpose. For example, you may not be able to cook in the kitchen. When there's no more room inside your home, the clutter may spread to the garage, vehicles, yard and other storage areas.
Hoarding ranges from mild to severe. In some cases, hoarding may not have much impact on your life, while in other cases it seriously affects your daily functioning.
People with hoarding disorder may not see it as a problem, so getting them to take part in treatment can be challenging. But intensive treatment can help you understand how your beliefs and behaviors can be changed so that you can live a safer, more enjoyable life.","The first symptoms of hoarding disorder often appear during the teenage to early adult years. You may get and save too many items, gradually build up clutter in living spaces, and have difficulty getting rid of things. | As you grow older, you may continue getting and holding onto things that you may never use and don't have space for. By middle age, the clutter can become overwhelming as symptoms become more severe and increasingly difficult to treat. | Problems with hoarding gradually develop over time and tend to be a private behavior. You may avoid having family, friends or repair workers in your home. Often, major clutter has developed by the time it reaches the attention of others. | Symptoms of hoarding disorder may include: | Getting and keeping too many items that you may not have a need for right now and don't have space for. | Ongoing difficulty throwing out or parting with your things, regardless of their actual value. | Feeling a need to save these items and being upset by the thought of getting rid of them. | Building up clutter to the point where you can't use rooms. | Trying to be perfect and avoiding or delaying decisions. | Problems with planning and organizing. | Getting too many items and refusing to part with them results in: | Disorganized piles or stacks of items, such as newspapers, clothes, paperwork, books or sentimental items. | Items that crowd and clutter your walking spaces and living areas. Rooms can't be used for the intended purpose, such as not being able to sleep in your bed. | Buildup of food or trash to large, unsanitary levels. | Distress or problems functioning or keeping yourself, others and pets safe in your home. | Conflict with others who try to reduce or remove clutter from your home. | Relationship issues, avoiding social activities and employment problems. | Difficulty organizing items and sometimes losing important items in the clutter. | With hoarding disorder, items are usually saved because: | You believe these items are unique or that you'll need them at some point in the future. | You feel emotionally connected to items that remind you of happier times or represent beloved people or pets. | You feel safe and comforted when surrounded by things. | You don't want to waste anything. | Hoarding disorder is different from collecting. People who have collections, such as stamps or model cars, carefully search out specific items, organize them and display their collections. Collections can be large, but they aren't usually cluttered. Also, they don't cause the distress and problems functioning that are part of hoarding disorder.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hoarding-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20356056
Binge-eating disorder,"Binge-eating disorder is a serious condition. It always involves feeling like you're not able to stop eating. It also often involves eating much larger than usual amounts of food.
Almost everyone overeats on occasion, such as having seconds or thirds of a holiday meal. But regularly feeling that eating is out of control and eating an unusually large amount of food may be symptoms of binge-eating disorder.
People who have binge-eating disorder often feel embarrassed or ashamed about eating binges. People with the disorder often go through periods of trying to restrict or severely cut back on their eating as a result. But this instead may increase urges to eat and lead to a cycle of ongoing binge eating. Treatment for binge-eating disorder can help people feel more in control and balanced with their eating.","If you have binge-eating disorder, you may be overweight or obese, or you may be at a healthy weight. Most people with binge-eating disorder feel upset about their body size or shape no matter what the number on the scale is. | Symptoms of binge-eating disorder vary but can include: | Feeling that you don't have control over your eating behavior, for example, you can't stop once you start. | Often eating much larger than usual amounts of food in a specific amount of time, such as over a two-hour period. | Eating even when you're full or not hungry. | Eating very fast during eating binges. | Eating until you're uncomfortably full. | Often eating alone or in secret. | Feeling depressed, disgusted, ashamed, guilty or upset about your eating. | A person with bulimia nervosa, another eating disorder, may binge and then vomit, use laxatives or exercise excessively to get rid of extra calories. This is not the case with binge-eating disorder. If you have binge-eating disorder, you may try to diet or eat less food at mealtimes to compensate. But restricting your diet may simply lead to more binge eating. | How much eating binges affect your mood and ability to function in daily life gives an idea of how serious the condition is for you. Binge-eating disorder can vary over time. The condition may be short-lived, may go away and come back, or may continue for years if left untreated.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/binge-eating-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20353627
Compulsive sexual behavior,"Compulsive sexual behavior is sometimes called hypersexuality or sexual addiction. It's an intense focus on sexual fantasies, urges or behaviors that can't be controlled. This causes distress and problems for your health, job, relationships or other parts of your life.
Compulsive sexual behavior may involve different kinds of commonly enjoyable sexual experiences. Examples include masturbation, sexual arousal by using a computer to communicate, multiple sexual partners, use of pornography or paying for sex. But when these sexual behaviors become a major, constant focus in your life, are difficult to control, cause problems in your life, or are harmful to you or others, that's likely compulsive sexual behavior.
No matter what it's called or the exact nature of the behavior, untreated compulsive sexual behavior can damage your self-esteem, relationships, career, health and other people. But with treatment and self-help, you can learn to manage compulsive sexual behavior.","Some signs that you may have compulsive sexual behavior include: | You have repeated and intense sexual fantasies, urges, and behaviors that take up a lot of your time and feel as if they're beyond your control. | You feel driven or have frequent urges to do certain sexual behaviors, feel a release of the tension afterward, but also feel guilt or deep regret. | You've tried without success to reduce or control your sexual fantasies, urges or behavior. | You use compulsive sexual behavior as an escape from other problems, such as loneliness, depression, anxiety or stress. | You continue to engage in sexual behaviors in spite of them causing serious problems. These could include the possibility of getting or giving someone else a sexually transmitted infection, the loss of important relationships, trouble at work, financial issues, or legal problems. | You have trouble making and keeping healthy and stable relationships.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/compulsive-sexual-behavior/symptoms-causes/syc-20360434
Kleptomania,"Kleptomania (klep-toe-MAY-nee-uh) is a mental health disorder that involves repeatedly being unable to resist urges to steal items that you generally don't really need. Often the items stolen have little value and you could afford to buy them. Kleptomania is rare but can be a serious condition. It can cause much emotional pain to you and your loved ones — and even legal problems — if not treated.
Kleptomania is a type of impulse control disorder — a disorder that involves problems with emotional or behavioral self-control. If you have an impulse control disorder, you have difficulty resisting the temptation or powerful urge to perform an act that's excessive or harmful to you or someone else.
Many people with kleptomania live lives of secret shame because they're afraid to seek mental health treatment. Although there's no cure for kleptomania, treatment with medicine or skill-building therapy that focuses on dealing with urges may help to end the cycle of compulsive stealing.","Kleptomania symptoms may include: | Inability to resist powerful urges to steal items that you don't need | Feeling increased tension, anxiety or arousal leading up to the theft | Feeling pleasure, relief or satisfaction while stealing | Feeling terrible guilt, remorse, self-loathing, shame or fear of arrest after the theft | Return of the urges and a repetition of the kleptomania cycle",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kleptomania/symptoms-causes/syc-20364732
Concussion,"A concussion is a mild traumatic brain injury that affects brain function. Effects are often short term and can include headaches and trouble with concentration, memory, balance, mood and sleep.
Concussions usually are caused by an impact to the head or body that is associated with a change in brain function. Not everyone who experiences a blow to the body or head has a concussion.
Some concussions cause the person to lose consciousness, but most do not.
Falls are the most common cause of concussions. Concussions also are common among athletes who play a contact sport, such as American football or soccer. Most people recover fully after a concussion.","The symptoms of a concussion can be subtle and may not occur right away. Symptoms can last for days, weeks or even longer. | Common symptoms after a mild traumatic brain injury are headache, confusion and loss of memory, known as amnesia. The amnesia usually involves forgetting the event that caused the concussion. | Physical symptoms of a concussion may include: | Headache. | Ringing in the ears. | Nausea. | Vomiting. | Fatigue or drowsiness. | Blurry vision. | Other symptoms of a concussion include: | Confusion or feeling as if in a fog. | Amnesia surrounding the event. | Dizziness or ""seeing stars."" | A witness may observe these symptoms in the person with a concussion: | Temporary loss of consciousness, though this doesn't always occur. | Slurred speech. | Delayed response to questions. | Dazed appearance. | Forgetfulness, such as asking the same question over and over. | Some symptoms of a concussion occur right away.

Genital warts,"Genital warts are one of the most common types of sexually transmitted infections. The virus that causes the warts is called human papillomavirus (HPV). There are various types ofHPV. And nearly all sexually active people will become infected with at least one type at some point.
Genital warts affect the moist tissues of the genital area. They can look like small, skin-colored bumps. The bumps may resemble cauliflower. Often, the warts are too small to be seen with your eyes.
Some strains of genitalHPVcan cause genital warts. Others can cause cancer. Vaccines can help protect against certain strains of genitalHPV.","Genital warts can grow on the: | Vulva. | Walls of the vagina. | Area between the outer part of the genitals and the anus. | Anal canal. | Cervix. | Tip or shaft of the penis. | Scrotum. | Anus. | Genital warts also can form in the mouth or throat of a person who has had oral sex with an infected person. | The symptoms of genital warts include: | Small swellings in the genital area that may be skin-colored or a different color. | A cauliflower-like shape caused by a few warts close together. | Itching or discomfort in your genital area. | Bleeding with sex. | Genital warts can be so small and flat that you can't see them.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is the medical name for a group of genetic conditions that affect the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are a pair of walnut-sized organs above the kidneys. They make important hormones, including:
In people withCAH, a gene change results in a lack of one of the enzyme proteins needed to make these hormones.
The two major types of congenital adrenal hyperplasia are:
There is no cure for congenital adrenal hyperplasia. But with proper treatment, most people who haveCAHcan lead full lives.","Symptoms ofCAHvary. The symptoms depend on which gene is affected. They also depend on how greatly the adrenal glands lack one of the enzymes needed to make hormones. WithCAH, the hormones that the body needs to work properly are thrown out of balance.

Congenital heart disease in adults,"Congenital heart disease is one or more problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. Congenital means that you're born with the condition. A congenital heart condition can change the way blood flows through the heart.
There are many different types of congenital heart defects. This article focuses on congenital heart disease in adults.
Some types of congenital heart disease may be mild. Others may cause life-threatening complications. Advances in diagnosis and treatment have improved survival for those born with a heart problem.
Treatment for congenital heart disease may include regular health checkups, medicines or surgery. If you have adult congenital heart disease, ask your healthcare professional how often you need a checkup.","Some people born with a heart problem don't notice symptoms until later in life. Symptoms also may return years after a congenital heart defect is treated. | Common congenital heart disease symptoms in adults include: | Irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias. | Blue or gray skin, lips and fingernails due to low oxygen levels. Depending on the skin color, these changes may be harder or easier to see. | Shortness of breath. | Feeling tired very quickly with activity. | Swelling due to fluid collecting inside body tissues, called edema.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adult-congenital-heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20355456

Craniosynostosis,"Craniosynostosis (kray-nee-o-sin-os-TOE-sis) is a disorder present at birth in which one or more of the fibrous joints between the bones of your baby's skull (cranial sutures) close prematurely (fuse), before your baby's brain is fully formed. Brain growth continues, giving the head a misshapen appearance.
Usually, during infancy the sutures remain flexible, allowing a baby's skull to expand as the brain grows. In the front of the skull, the sutures meet in the large soft spot (fontanel) on top of the head. The anterior fontanel is the soft spot felt just behind a baby's forehead. The next largest fontanel is at the back (posterior). Each side of the skull has a tiny fontanel.
Craniosynostosis usually involves premature fusion of a single cranial suture, but it can involve more than one of the sutures in a baby's skull (multiple suture craniosynostosis). In rare cases, craniosynostosis is caused by certain genetic syndromes (syndromic craniosynostosis).
Treating craniosynostosis involves surgery to correct the shape of the head and allow for brain growth. Early diagnosis and treatment allow your baby's brain adequate space to grow and develop.
Although neurological damage can occur in severe cases, most children develop as expected in their ability to think and reason (cognitive development) and have good cosmetic results after surgery. Early diagnosis and treatment are key.","The signs of craniosynostosis are usually noticeable at birth, but they become more apparent during the first few months of your baby's life. Signs and severity depend on how many sutures are fused and when in brain development the fusion occurs. Signs and symptoms can include: | A misshapen skull, with the shape depending on which of the sutures are affected | Development of a raised, hard ridge along affected sutures, with a change in the shape of the head that's not typical",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/craniosynostosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354513
Heart failure,"Heart failure occurs when the heart muscle doesn't pump blood as well as it should. When this happens, blood often backs up and fluid can build up in the lungs, causing shortness of breath.
Some heart conditions slowly leave the heart too weak or stiff to fill and pump blood properly. These conditions include narrowed arteries in the heart and high blood pressure.
Proper treatment may improve the symptoms of heart failure and may help some people live longer. Lifestyle changes can improve quality of life. Try to lose weight, exercise, use less salt and manage stress.
But heart failure can be life-threatening. People with heart failure may have severe symptoms. Some may need a heart transplant or a device to help the heart pump blood.
Heart failure also may be called congestive heart failure.","If you have heart failure, your heart can't supply enough blood to meet your body's needs. | Symptoms may develop slowly. Sometimes, heart failure symptoms start suddenly. Heart failure symptoms may include: | Shortness of breath with activity or when lying down. | Fatigue and weakness. | Swelling in the legs, ankles and feet. | Rapid or irregular heartbeat. | Reduced ability to exercise. | Wheezing. | A cough that doesn't go away or a cough that brings up white or pink mucus with spots of blood. | Swelling of the belly area. | Very rapid weight gain from fluid buildup. | Nausea and lack of appetite. | Difficulty concentrating or decreased alertness. | Chest pain if heart failure is caused by a heart attack.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373142
Conjoined twins,"Conjoined twins are two babies who are born physically connected to each other.
Conjoined twins develop when an early embryo only partially separates to form two individuals. Although two babies develop from this embryo, they remain physically connected — most often at the chest, abdomen or pelvis. Conjoined twins may also share one or more internal body organs.
Though many conjoined twins are not alive when born (stillborn) or die shortly after birth, advances in surgery and technology have improved survival rates. Some surviving conjoined twins can be surgically separated. The success of surgery depends on where the twins are joined and how many and which organs are shared. It also depends on the experience and skill of the surgical team.","There are no specific symptoms that indicate a conjoined twin pregnancy. As with other twin pregnancies, the uterus may grow faster than it does with a single baby. And there may be more tiredness, nausea and vomiting early in the pregnancy. Conjoined twins can be diagnosed early in the pregnancy using an ultrasound.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/conjoined-twins/symptoms-causes/syc-20353910
Pink eye (conjunctivitis),"Pink eye is an inflammation of the transparent membrane that lines the eyelid and eyeball. This membrane is called the conjunctiva. When small blood vessels in the conjunctiva become swollen and irritated, they're more visible. This is what causes the whites of the eyes to appear reddish or pink. Pink eye also is called conjunctivitis.
Pink eye is most often caused by a viral infection. It also can be caused by a bacterial infection, an allergic reaction or — in babies — an incompletely opened tear duct.
Though pink eye can be irritating, it rarely affects your vision. Treatments can help ease the discomfort of pink eye. Because pink eye can be contagious, getting an early diagnosis and taking certain precautions can help limit its spread.","The most common pink eye symptoms include: | Redness in one or both eyes. | Itchiness in one or both eyes. | A gritty feeling in one or both eyes. | A discharge in one or both eyes that forms a crust during the night that may prevent your eye or eyes from opening in the morning. | Tearing. | Sensitivity to light, called photophobia.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pink-eye/symptoms-causes/syc-20376355
Constipation,"Constipation is a problem with passing stool. Constipation generally means passing fewer than three stools a week or having a difficult time passing stool.
Constipation is fairly common. A lack of dietary fiber, fluids and exercise can cause constipation. But other medical conditions or certain medicines may be the cause.
Constipation is usually treated with changes in diet and exercise or with nonprescription medicines. Constipation may require medicines, changes in medicines or other treatments prescribed by a health care professional.
Long-term constipation, also called chronic constipation, may require treating another disease or condition that can cause or worsen constipation.","Symptoms of constipation include: | Fewer than three stools a week. | Hard, dry or lumpy stools. | Straining or pain when passing stools. | A feeling that not all stool has passed. | A feeling that the rectum is blocked. | The need to use a finger to pass stool. | Chronic constipation is having two or more of these symptoms for three months or longer.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/constipation/symptoms-causes/syc-20354253

Contact dermatitis,"Contact dermatitis is an itchy rash caused by direct contact with a substance or an allergic reaction to it. The rash isn't contagious, but it can be very uncomfortable.
Many substances can cause this reaction, such as cosmetics, fragrances, jewelry and plants. The rash often shows up within days of exposure.
To treat contact dermatitis successfully, you need to identify and avoid the cause of your reaction. If you avoid the substance causing the reaction, the rash often clears up in 2 to 4 weeks. You can try soothing your skin with a cool, wet cloth and other self-care steps.","Contact dermatitis shows up on skin that has been directly exposed to the substance causing the reaction. For example, the rash may show up along a leg that brushed against poison ivy. The rash can develop within minutes to hours of exposure, and it can last 2 to 4 weeks. | Signs and symptoms of contact dermatitis vary widely and may include: | An itchy rash | Leathery patches that are darker than usual (hyperpigmented), typically on brown or Black skin | Dry, cracked, scaly skin, typically on white skin | Bumps and blisters, sometimes with oozing and crusting | Swelling, burning or tenderness",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/contact-dermatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352742

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"COVID-19, also called coronavirus disease 2019, is an illness caused by a virus. The virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or more commonly, SARS-CoV-2. It started spreading at the end of 2019 and became a pandemic disease in 2020.
The virus that causesCOVID-19spreads most commonly through the air in tiny droplets of fluid between people in close contact. Many people withCOVID-19have no symptoms or mild illness. But for older adults and people with certain medical conditions,COVID-19can lead to the need for care in the hospital or death.
Staying up to date on yourCOVID-19vaccine helps prevent serious illness, the need for hospital care due toCOVID-19and death fromCOVID-19. Other ways that may help prevent the spread of this coronavirus includes good indoor air flow, physical distancing, wearing a mask in the right setting and good hygiene.
Medicine can limit the seriousness of the viral infection. Most people recover without long-term effects, but some people have symptoms that continue for months.","TypicalCOVID-19symptoms often show up 2 to 14 days after contact with the virus. | Symptoms can include: | Dry cough. | Shortness of breath. | Loss of taste or smell. | Extreme tiredness, called fatigue. | Digestive symptoms such as upset stomach, vomiting or loose stools, called diarrhea. | Pain, such as headaches and body or muscle aches. | Fever or chills. | Cold-like symptoms such as congestion, runny nose or sore throat. | People may only have a few symptoms or none. People who have no symptoms but test positive forCOVID-19are called asymptomatic. For example, many children who test positive don't have symptoms ofCOVID-19illness. People who go on to have symptoms are considered presymptomatic. Both groups can still spreadCOVID-19to others. | Some people may have symptoms that get worse about 7 to 14 days after symptoms start. | Most people withCOVID-19have mild to moderate symptoms. ButCOVID-19can cause serious medical complications and lead to death. Older adults or people who already have medical conditions are at greater risk of serious illness. | COVID-19may be a mild, moderate, severe or critical illness. | In broad terms, mild COVID-19 doesn't affect the ability of the lungs to get oxygen to the body. | In moderate COVID-19 illness, the lungs also work properly but there are signs that the infection is deep in the lungs. | Severe COVID-19 means that the lungs don't work correctly, and the person needs oxygen and other medical help in the hospital. | Critical COVID-19 illness means the lung and breathing system, called the respiratory system, has failed and there is damage throughout the body. | Rarely, people who catch the coronavirus can develop a group of symptoms linked to inflamed organs or tissues. The illness is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome. When children have this illness, it is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, shortened toMIS-C.

Cradle cap,"Cradle cap causes crusty or oily scaly patches on a baby's scalp. The condition isn't painful or itchy. But it can cause thick white or yellow scales that aren't easy to remove.
Cradle cap usually clears up on its own in weeks or a few months. Home care measures include washing your baby's scalp daily with a mild shampoo. This can help you loosen and remove the scales. Don't scratch cradle cap.
If cradle cap doesn't stop or seems serious, your baby's doctor or other health care professional may suggest a medicated shampoo, lotion or other treatment.","Common symptoms of cradle cap include: | Patchy scaling or thick crusts on the scalp. | Oily or dry skin covered with flaky white or yellow scales. | Skin flakes. | Mild inflammation. | Similar scales also may be present on the ears, eyelids, nose and groin. | Cradle cap is common in newborns.

Giant cell arteritis,"Giant cell arteritis is an inflammation of the lining of your arteries. Most often, it affects the arteries in your head, especially those in your temples. For this reason, giant cell arteritis is sometimes called temporal arteritis.
Giant cell arteritis frequently causes headaches, scalp tenderness, jaw pain and vision problems. Untreated, it can lead to blindness.
Prompt treatment with corticosteroid medications usually relieves symptoms of giant cell arteritis and might prevent loss of vision. You'll likely begin to feel better within days of starting treatment. But even with treatment, relapses are common.
You'll need to visit your doctor regularly for checkups and treatment of any side effects from taking corticosteroids.","The most common symptoms of giant cell arteritis are head pain and tenderness — often severe — that usually affects both temples. Head pain can progressively worsen, come and go, or subside temporarily. | Generally, signs and symptoms of giant cell arteritis include: | Persistent, severe head pain, usually in your temple area | Scalp tenderness | Jaw pain when you chew or open your mouth wide | Fever | Fatigue | Unintended weight loss | Vision loss or double vision, particularly in people who also have jaw pain | Sudden, permanent loss of vision in one eye | Pain and stiffness in the neck, shoulders or hips are common symptoms of a related disorder, polymyalgia rheumatica.

Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS),"Sudden infant death syndrome is the unexplained death of a baby. The baby is usually less than a year old and seems to be healthy. It often happens during sleep. Sudden infant death syndrome also is known asSIDS. It is sometimes called crib death because infants often die in their cribs.
The cause ofSIDSis unknown. But it may be caused by problems in the area of an infant's brain that controls breathing and waking up from sleep.
Researchers have found some things that might put babies at higher risk. They've also found some things you can do to help protect your child fromSIDS. The most important action may be to place a baby on the back to sleep.",,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sudden-infant-death-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20352800
Crohn's disease,"Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes swelling and irritation of the tissues, called inflammation, in the digestive tract. This can lead to belly pain, severe diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss and malnutrition.
Inflammation caused by Crohn's disease can affect different areas of the digestive tract in different people. Crohn's most commonly affects the end of the small intestine and the beginning of the large intestine. The inflammation often spreads into the deeper layers of the bowel.
Crohn's disease can be both painful and debilitating. Sometimes, it may lead to serious or life-threatening complications.
There's no known cure for Crohn's disease, but therapies can greatly reduce its symptoms and even bring about long-term remission and healing of inflammation. With treatment, many people with Crohn's disease can function well.","Symptoms of Crohn's disease typically include: | Diarrhea. | Fever. | Fatigue. | Belly pain and cramping. | Blood in the stool. | Mouth sores. | Reduced appetite and weight loss. | Pain or drainage near or around the anus due to inflammation from a tunnel into the skin, called a fistula. | Crohn's disease can affect any part of the small or large intestine. It may involve multiple segments, or it may be continuous. It most commonly involves the last part of the small intestine. In some people, the disease is only in the colon or the large intestine. | Symptoms of Crohn's disease can range from mild to severe.

Cryoglobulinemia,"Cryoglobulinemia is a family of rare conditions, called vasculitis. Vasculitis causes irritation and swelling, called inflammation, of the blood vessels.
Cryoglobulins are atypical proteins in the blood. For people who have cryoglobulinemia (kry-o-glob-u-lih-NEE-me-uh), these proteins may clump together at body temperatures below 98.6 F (37 C).
These clumps can block blood flow. This can damage the skin, joints, nerves and organs, mainly the kidneys and liver.","Some people have no symptoms of cryoglobulinemia. For people who have symptoms, the symptoms might come and go. They can include: | Skin spots.Most people with cryoglobulinemia get purple skin spots, called lesions, on their legs.

Undescended testicle,"A testicle that doesn't move down into its proper place in the scrotum before birth is called an undescended testicle. It's also known as cryptorchidism (krip-TOR-kih-diz-um). Most often, it's just one testicle that doesn't descend into the scrotum, which is the bag of skin that hangs below the penis. But sometimes both testicles are affected.
An undescended testicle is more common in premature babies than it is in full-term infants. An undescended testicle often moves down on its own within a few months after the baby is born. If your baby has an undescended testicle that doesn't correct itself, surgery can be done to move the testicle into the scrotum.","Not seeing or feeling a testicle in the scrotum is the main symptom of an undescended testicle. | Testicles form in an unborn baby's lower belly. During the last few months of pregnancy, the testicles typically move down from the stomach area.

Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma,"Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is a rare type of cancer that begins in the white blood cells. The cancer affects white blood cells called T cells, also called T lymphocytes. These cells help the body's germ-fighting immune system. In cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, the T cells attack the skin.
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, also called CTCL, can cause rash and slightly raised or scaly round patches on the skin. Sometimes other growths appear on the skin.
There are several types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The most common types include:
Treatment depends on the type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Treatments can include skin creams, light therapy, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Another type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that affects the skin is called cutaneous B-cell lymphoma. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is much more common than cutaneous B-cell lymphoma.","Signs and symptoms of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma include: | Patches of raised or scaly skin that might itch. The patches happen most often on skin that doesn't get much sun. | Patches of skin that look pink, red, brown or gray. The color may be harder to see on Black and brown skin. | Patches of skin that look lighter in color than the skin around them. This may be easier to see on Black and brown skin. | Lumps that form on the skin and may break open. | Lymph nodes that get bigger. | Hair loss. | Thickened skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. | A rash over all the skin that is scaly and itchy.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cutaneous-t-cell-lymphoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20351056
Peyronie disease,"Peyronie (pay-roe-NEE) disease is a condition in which fibrous scar tissue forms in the deeper tissues under the skin of the penis. This causes curved, painful erections. It also can make the penis shorter while erect. Peyronie disease is not caused by cancer.
Penises vary in shape and size. So having a curved erection isn't always a cause for concern. But Peyronie disease causes a serious bend or pain in some people.
This can prevent you from having sex. Or it might make it hard to get or keep an erection, which also is called erectile dysfunction. For many people, Peyronie disease also causes stress and anxiety.
Peyronie disease rarely goes away on its own. In most people with the condition, it will remain as is or may get slightly worse early on. Early treatment soon after you get the condition may keep it from getting worse or even improve symptoms. Even if you've had Peyronie disease for some time, treatment may help ease symptoms such as pain, curving and shortening.","Peyronie disease symptoms might start suddenly or appear over time. The most common symptoms include: | Scar tissue.The scar tissue linked with Peyronie disease also is called plaque. It's different from plaque that can build up in blood vessels or on your teeth. It can be felt under the skin of the penis as flat lumps or a band of hard tissue. The area over the scar tissue may feel tender. | A bend to the penis.The penis might curve upward or downward or bend to one side. | Erection problems.Peyronie disease might cause problems getting or keeping an erection. This also is called erectile dysfunction. Often though, people with Peyronie disease say they notice erectile dysfunction before the start of their other penile symptoms. | Shortening of the penis.The penis might become shorter during erections due to Peyronie disease. | Pain in the penis.This symptom might happen with or without an erection. | Other changes in how the penis looks.In some people with Peyronie disease, the erect penis might look narrow or indented. It might even take on an hourglass-like shape, with a tight, narrow band around the shaft. | The curving and penile shortening linked with Peyronie disease might become worse over time. Physical changes in the penis often get worse or stay the same during the first year to year and a half. | Pain during erections usually gets better within 1 to 2 years. The scar tissue, penile shortening and curving often remain. It's not common, but the curving and pain of Peyronie disease can get better without treatment.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peyronies-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353468
Scoliosis,"Scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine that most often is diagnosed in adolescents. While scoliosis can occur in people with conditions such as cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy, the cause of most childhood scoliosis is not known.
Most cases of scoliosis are mild, but some curves worsen as children grow. Severe scoliosis can be disabling. An especially serious spinal curve can reduce the amount of space within the chest, making it difficult for the lungs to function properly.
Children who have mild scoliosis are monitored closely, usually with X-rays, to see if the curve is getting worse. In many cases, no treatment is necessary. Some children may need to wear a brace to stop the curve from worsening. Others may need surgery to straighten more serious curves.","Symptoms of scoliosis may include: | Uneven shoulders. | One shoulder blade that appears more prominent than the other. | Uneven waist. | One hip higher than the other. | One side of the rib cage jutting forward. | A prominence on one side of the back when bending forward. | With most scoliosis cases, the spine will rotate or twist in addition to curving side to side. This causes the ribs or muscles on one side of the body to stick out farther than those on the other side.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/scoliosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350716
Cushing syndrome,"Cushing syndrome happens when the body has too much of the hormone cortisol for a long time. This can result from the body making too much cortisol, or from taking medicines called glucocorticoids, which affect the body the same way as cortisol.
Too much cortisol can cause some of the main symptoms of Cushing syndrome — a fatty hump between the shoulders, a rounded face, and pink or purple stretch marks on the skin. Cushing syndrome also can cause high blood pressure or bone loss. Sometimes, it can cause type 2 diabetes.
Treatments for Cushing syndrome can lower the body's cortisol levels and improve symptoms. The sooner treatment starts, the better the chances for recovery.",Symptoms of Cushing syndrome can vary depending on the level of extra cortisol.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cushing-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20351310

The types of cutaneous B-cell lymphoma include:
Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma symptoms include a lump or group of lumps on the skin. Sometimes this cancer causes hard patches of skin.
Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Another type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that affects the skin is called cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is more common than cutaneous B-cell lymphoma.","Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma usually appears as a lump or group of lumps on the skin that don't go away.

Self-injury/cutting,"Nonsuicidal self-injury, often simply called self-injury, is the act of harming your own body on purpose, such as by cutting or burning yourself. It's usually not meant as a suicide attempt. This type of self-injury is a harmful way to cope with emotional pain, sadness, anger and stress.
While self-injury may bring a brief sense of calm and a release of physical and emotional tension, it's usually followed by guilt and shame and the return of painful emotions. Life-threatening injuries are usually not intended, but it's possible that more-serious and even fatal self-harm could happen.
Getting the proper treatment can help you learn healthier ways to cope.","Symptoms of self-injury may include: | Scars, often in patterns. | Fresh cuts, scratches, bruises, bite marks or other wounds. | Excessive rubbing of an area to create a burn. | Keeping sharp objects or other items used for self-injury on hand. | Wearing long sleeves or long pants to hide self-injury, even in hot weather. | Frequent reports of accidental injury. | Difficulties in relationships with others. | Behaviors and emotions that change quickly and are impulsive, intense and unexpected. | Talk of helplessness, hopelessness or worthlessness.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/self-injury/symptoms-causes/syc-20350950

Cyclothymia (cyclothymic disorder),"Cyclothymia (sy-kloe-THIE-me-uh), also called cyclothymic disorder, is a rare mood disorder. Cyclothymia causes emotional ups and downs, but they're not as extreme as those in bipolar I or II disorder.
With cyclothymia, you experience periods when your mood noticeably shifts up and down from your baseline. You may feel on top of the world for a time, followed by a low period when you feel somewhat down. Between these cyclothymic highs and lows, you may feel stable and fine.
Although the highs and lows of cyclothymia are less extreme than those of bipolar disorder, it's critical to seek help managing these symptoms because they can interfere with your ability to function and increase your risk of bipolar I or II disorder.
Treatment options for cyclothymia include talk therapy (psychotherapy), medications and close, ongoing follow-up with your doctor.","Cyclothymia symptoms alternate between emotional highs and lows. The highs of cyclothymia include symptoms of an elevated mood (hypomanic symptoms). The lows consist of mild or moderate depressive symptoms. | Cyclothymia symptoms are similar to those of bipolar I or II disorder, but they're less severe. When you have cyclothymia, you can typically function in your daily life, though not always well. The unpredictable nature of your mood shifts may significantly disrupt your life because you never know how you're going to feel.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cyclothymia/symptoms-causes/syc-20371275

Ganglion cyst,"Ganglion cysts are lumps that most often appear along the tendons or joints of wrists or hands. They also can occur in ankles and feet. Ganglion cysts are typically round or oval and are filled with a jellylike fluid. They are not cancer.
Small ganglion cysts can be pea-sized. They can change size. Ganglion cysts can be painful if they press on a nearby nerve. Sometimes they affect joint movement.
For a ganglion cyst that causes problems, having a health care provider drain the cyst with a needle might be an option. So might removing the cyst surgically. But if there are no symptoms, no treatment is necessary. Often, the cysts grow and shrink. Some go away on their own.","These are common features of ganglion cysts: | Location.Ganglion cysts most often develop along the tendons or joints of wrists or hands. The next most common locations are the ankles and feet. These cysts grow near other joints too. | Shape and size.Ganglion cysts are round or oval. Some are too small to feel. The size of a cyst can change, often getting larger over time with joint movement. | Pain.Ganglion cysts usually are painless. But if a cyst presses on a nerve or other structures, it can cause pain, tingling, numbness or muscle weakness.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ganglion-cyst/symptoms-causes/syc-20351156
Kidney cysts,"Kidney cysts are round pouches of fluid that form on or in the kidneys. Kidney cysts can occur with disorders that may impair kidney function. But more often, kidney cysts are a type called simple kidney cysts. Simple kidney cysts aren't cancer and rarely cause problems.
It's not clear what causes simple kidney cysts. Often, one cyst occurs on the surface of a kidney. But more than one cyst can appear on one or both kidneys. Simple kidney cysts aren't the same as cysts that form with polycystic kidney disease. Simple cysts also differ from complex cysts. Complex cysts need to be watched for changes that could be cancer.
Simple kidney cysts are often found during an imaging test for another condition. Treatment usually isn't needed unless simple cysts cause symptoms.","Simple kidney cysts typically don't cause symptoms. But if a simple kidney cyst grows large enough, symptoms may include: | Dull pain in the back or side | Fever | Upper stomach pain",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-cysts/symptoms-causes/syc-20374134
Ovarian cysts,"Ovarian cysts are sacs, usually filled with fluid, in an ovary or on its surface. Females have two ovaries. One ovary is located on each side of the uterus.
Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. Eggs develop and mature in the ovaries. Eggs are released in monthly cycles during the childbearing years.
Ovarian cysts are common. Most of the time, you have little or no discomfort, and the cysts are harmless. Most cysts go away without treatment within a few months.
But sometimes ovarian cysts can become twisted or burst open (rupture). This can cause serious symptoms. To protect your health, get regular pelvic exams and know the symptoms that can signal what might be a serious problem.","Most ovarian cysts cause no symptoms and go away on their own. But a large ovarian cyst can cause: | Pelvic pain that may come and go. You may feel a dull ache or a sharp pain in the area below your bellybutton toward one side. | Fullness, pressure or heaviness in your belly (abdomen). | Bloating.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cysts/symptoms-causes/syc-20353405

Cystitis,"Cystitis (sis-TIE-tis) is the medical term for inflammation of the bladder. Inflammation is when a part of your body is swollen and hot. It can also be painful.
Most of the time, cystitis happens when there's an infection caused by bacteria. This is called a urinary tract infection (UTI). Having a bladder infection can be painful and annoying. It can become a serious health problem if the infection spreads to your kidneys.
Cystitis also may occur as a reaction to certain drugs or radiation therapy. Things that sometimes irritate the bladder, such as hygiene products, spermicide jelly or long-term catheter use, can also lead to cystitis. Cystitis can also happen as a complication of another illness.
The usual treatment for cystitis caused by bacteria is to take antibiotic medication. Treatment for other types of cystitis depends on the cause.","Cystitis signs and symptoms may include: | A strong, persistent urge to urinate | Pain or a burning feeling when urinating | Passing frequent, small amounts of urine | Blood in the urine (hematuria) | Passing cloudy or strong-smelling urine | Pelvic discomfort | A feeling of pressure in the area below your belly button (abdomen) | Low-grade fever | In young children, new episodes of accidental daytime wetting also may be a sign of a urinary tract infection (UTI).

Anterior vaginal prolapse (cystocele),"Anterior vaginal prolapse, also known as a cystocele (SIS-toe-seel) or a prolapsed bladder, is when the bladder drops from its usual position in the pelvis and pushes on the wall of the vagina.
The organs of the pelvis — including the bladder, uterus and intestines — are typically held in place by the muscles and connective tissues of the pelvic floor. Anterior prolapse occurs when the pelvic floor becomes weak or if too much pressure is put on the pelvic floor. This can happen over time, during vaginal childbirth or with chronic constipation, violent coughing or heavy lifting.
Anterior prolapse is treatable. For a mild or moderate prolapse, nonsurgical treatment is often effective. In more severe cases, surgery may be necessary to keep the vagina and other pelvic organs in their proper positions.","In mild cases of anterior prolapse, you may not notice any signs or symptoms. When signs and symptoms occur, they may include: | A feeling of fullness or pressure in your pelvis and vagina | In some cases, a bulge of tissue in your vagina that you can see or feel | Increased pelvic pressure when you strain, cough, bear down or lift | Problems urinating, including difficulty starting a urine stream, the feeling that you haven't completely emptied your bladder after urinating, feeling a frequent need to urinate or leaking urine (urinary incontinence) | Signs and symptoms often are especially noticeable after standing for long periods of time and may go away when you lie down.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cystocele/symptoms-causes/syc-20369452
Epidermoid cysts,"Epidermoid (ep-ih-DUR-moid) cysts are harmless small bumps beneath the skin. They are most common on the face, neck and trunk.
Epidermoid cysts are slow growing and often painless, so they rarely cause problems or need treatment. You might choose to have a cyst removed if it bothers you, breaks open, or is painful or infected.","Epidermoid cyst signs and symptoms include: | A small, round bump under the skin, often on the face, neck or trunk | A tiny blackhead plugging the central opening of the cyst | A thick, smelly, cheesy substance that leaks from the cyst | An inflamed or infected bump",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epidermoid-cysts/symptoms-causes/syc-20352701

Mild dandruff can be treated with a gentle daily shampoo. If that doesn't work, a medicated shampoo may help. Symptoms may return later.
Dandruff is a mild form of seborrheic dermatitis.","Dandruff signs and symptoms may include: | Skin flakes on your scalp, hair, eyebrows, beard or mustache, and shoulders | Itchy scalp | Scaly, crusty scalp in infants with cradle cap | The signs and symptoms may be more severe if you're stressed, and they tend to flare in cold, dry seasons.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dandruff/symptoms-causes/syc-20353850
Narcolepsy,"Narcolepsy is a condition that makes people very sleepy during the day and can cause them to fall asleep suddenly. Some people also have other symptoms, such as muscle weakness when they feel strong emotions.
The symptoms can have serious effects on daily life. People with narcolepsy have trouble staying awake for long periods of time. When narcolepsy causes a sudden loss of muscle tone, it is known as cataplexy (KAT-uh-plek-see). This can be triggered by a strong emotion, especially one that causes laughter.
Narcolepsy is divided into two types. Most people with type 1 narcolepsy have cataplexy. Most people with type 2 narcolepsy don't have cataplexy.
Narcolepsy is a lifelong condition and does not have a cure. However, medicines and lifestyle changes can help manage the symptoms. Support from family, friends, employers and teachers can help people cope with the condition.","The symptoms of narcolepsy may get worse during the first few years. Then they continue for life. Symptoms include: | Extreme daytime sleepiness.Daytime sleepiness is the first symptom to appear, and the sleepiness makes it hard to focus and function. People with narcolepsy feel less alert and focused during the day. They also fall asleep without warning. Sleep can happen anywhere and at any time. It may happen when they are bored or while doing a task. For example, people with narcolepsy can suddenly fall asleep while working or talking with friends. It can be especially dangerous to fall asleep while driving. Sleep may last only a few minutes or up to a half-hour. After waking, people with narcolepsy feel refreshed but get sleepy again. | Automatic behaviors.Some people with narcolepsy continue doing a task when they fall asleep briefly. For example, they may fall asleep while writing, typing or driving. They might continue to perform that task while asleep. After waking, they can't remember what they did, and they probably didn't do it well. | Sudden loss of muscle tone.This condition is called cataplexy. It can cause slurred speech or complete weakness of most muscles for up to a few minutes. It's triggered by intense emotions — often positive emotions. Laughter or excitement may cause sudden muscle weakness. But sometimes fear, surprise or anger can cause the loss of muscle tone. For example, when you laugh, your head may drop without your control. Or your knees may suddenly lose strength, causing you to fall. Some people with narcolepsy experience only one or two episodes of cataplexy a year. Others have several episodes a day. Not everyone with narcolepsy has these symptoms. | Sleep paralysis.People with narcolepsy may experience sleep paralysis. During sleep paralysis, the person can't move or speak while falling asleep or upon waking. The paralysis is usually brief — lasting a few seconds or minutes. But it can be scary. You may be aware of it happening and can recall it afterward. Not everyone with sleep paralysis has narcolepsy. | Hallucinations.Sometimes people see things that aren't there during sleep paralysis. Hallucinations also may happen in bed without sleep paralysis. These are called hypnagogic hallucinations if they happen as you fall asleep. They're called hypnopompic hallucinations if they happen upon waking. For example, the person might think they see a stranger in the bedroom who isn't there. These hallucinations may be vivid and frightening because you may not be fully asleep when you begin dreaming. | Changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.REM sleep is when most dreaming happens. Typically, people enter REM sleep 60 to 90 minutes after falling asleep. But people with narcolepsy often move more quickly to REM sleep. They tend to enter REM sleep within 15 minutes of falling asleep. REM sleep also can happen at any time of the day.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcolepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20375497
Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS),"Ductal carcinoma in situ is a very early form of breast cancer. In ductal carcinoma in situ, the cancer cells are confined inside a milk duct in the breast. The cancer cells haven't spread into the breast tissue. Ductal carcinoma in situ is often shortened to DCIS. It's sometimes called noninvasive, preinvasive or stage 0 breast cancer.
DCIS is usually found during a mammogram done as part of breast cancer screening or to investigate a breast lump. DCIS has a low risk of spreading and becoming life-threatening. However, it does require an evaluation and a consideration of treatment options.
Treatment for DCIS often involves surgery. Other treatments may combine surgery with radiation therapy or hormone therapy.","Ductal carcinoma in situ doesn't typically cause symptoms. This early form of breast cancer also is called DCIS. | DCIS can sometimes cause symptoms such as: | A breast lump. | Bloody nipple discharge. | DCIS is usually found on a mammogram. It appears as tiny flecks of calcium in the breast tissue. These are calcium deposits, often referred to as calcifications.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dcis/symptoms-causes/syc-20371889
Hip dysplasia,"Hip dysplasia is the medical term for a hip socket that doesn't fully cover the ball portion of the upper thighbone. This allows the hip joint to become partially or completely dislocated. Most people with hip dysplasia are born with the condition.
Healthcare professionals will check your baby for signs of hip dysplasia shortly after birth and during well-baby visits. If hip dysplasia is diagnosed in early infancy, a soft brace can usually correct the problem.
Mild hip dysplasia might not start causing symptoms until a person is a teenager or young adult. Hip dysplasia can damage the cartilage lining the joint. It also can hurt the soft cartilage, called the labrum, that rims the socket portion of the hip joint. This is called a hip labral tear.
In older children and young adults, surgery may be needed to move the bones into the proper positions for smooth joint movement.","Symptoms vary by age group. In infants, you might notice that one leg is longer than the other. Once a child begins walking, a limp may develop. During diaper changes, one hip may be less flexible than the other. | In teenagers and young adults, hip dysplasia can cause painful complications such as osteoarthritis or a hip labral tear. This may cause activity-related groin pain.

Color blindness,"Color blindness is an eye condition in which someone can't see the difference between certain colors. Though many people commonly use the term ""color blind"" for this condition, true color blindness — in which everything is seen in shades of black and white — is rare. The medical term for color blindness is known as color vision deficiency.
Color blindness is usually inherited, meaning it's passed down through families. Men are more likely to be born with color blindness. Most people with color blindness can't tell the difference between certain shades of red and green. Less commonly, people with color blindness can't tell the difference between shades of blue and yellow.
Certain eye diseases and some medicines also can cause color blindness.","You may have a color vision deficiency and not know it. Some people figure out that they or their child has the condition when it causes confusion — such as when there are problems differentiating the colors in a traffic light or interpreting color-coded learning materials. | People affected by color blindness may not be able to distinguish: | Different shades of red and green. | Different shades of blue and yellow. | Any colors. | The most common color deficiency is an inability to see some shades of red and green.

Delayed ejaculation,"Delayed ejaculation is a condition in which it takes a long period of sexual arousal to reach climax and release semen from the penis, called ejaculate. Some people with delayed ejaculation can't ejaculate at all.
Delayed ejaculation can be a brief or lifelong problem. Possible causes of delayed ejaculation include certain ongoing health conditions, surgeries and medicines. Treatment for delayed ejaculation depends on the cause.
Delayed ejaculation can happen from time to time. Delayed ejaculation is a problem only if it's ongoing and causes stress or worry for you and your partner.","There's no set time that means a diagnosis of delayed ejaculation. Some people with delayed ejaculation need many minutes of sexual stimulation to have an orgasm and ejaculate. Others might not be able to ejaculate at all, called anejaculation. | In delayed ejaculation, the delay causes upset. Also delayed ejaculation might mean stopping sex due to tiredness, physical irritation, loss of erection or because the partner wants to stop. | Often, there's trouble reaching orgasm during sexual intercourse or other sexual activities with a partner. Some people can ejaculate only when masturbating. But others may not be able to ejaculate by masturbating. | Delayed ejaculation is divided into the following types based on symptoms: | Lifelong versus acquired.With lifelong delayed ejaculation, the problem is present from the time of sexual maturity.

Gastroparesis,"Gastroparesis is a condition in which the muscles in the stomach don't move food as they should for it to be digested.
Most often, muscles contract to send food through the digestive tract. But with gastroparesis, the stomach's movement, called motility, slows or doesn't work at all. This keeps the stomach from emptying well.
Often, the cause of gastroparesis is not known. Sometimes it's linked to diabetes. And some people get gastroparesis after surgery or after a viral illness.
Certain medicines, such as opioid pain relievers, some antidepressants, and medicines for high blood pressure, weight loss and allergies can slow stomach emptying. The symptoms can be like those of gastroparesis. For people who already have gastroparesis, these medicines may make the condition worse.
Gastroparesis affects digestion. It can cause nausea, vomiting and belly pain. It also can cause problems with blood sugar levels and nutrition. There's no cure for gastroparesis. But medicines and changes to diet can give some relief.","Symptoms of gastroparesis include: | Vomiting. | Nausea. | Belly bloating. | Belly pain. | Feeling full after eating just a few bites and long after eating a meal. | Vomiting undigested food eaten a few hours earlier. | Acid reflux. | Changes in blood sugar levels. | Not wanting to eat. | Weight loss and not getting enough nutrients, called malnutrition. | Many people with gastroparesis don't notice any symptoms.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gastroparesis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355787
Delayed sleep phase,"Delayed sleep phase is a sleep disorder that affects the internal clock, known as circadian rhythm. People with this sleep disorder have sleep patterns that are delayed two hours or more from usual sleep patterns. They go to sleep later and wake later. This makes it hard to wake in time for work or school. Delayed sleep phase also is known as delayed sleep-wake phase disorder.
A treatment plan might include making changes to sleep habits, taking melatonin supplements and using light therapy.","People with delayed sleep phase fall asleep and wake later than they want and later than usual sleep and wake times. Sleep and wake times are delayed at least two hours and may be delayed up to 3 to 6 hours. People with delayed sleep phase may regularly go to sleep at 3 a.m. and wake at 10 a.m., for example. | Symptoms are persistent. They last at least three months and often for years.

Delirium,"Delirium is a serious change in mental abilities. It results in confused thinking and a lack of awareness of someone's surroundings. The disorder usually comes on fast — within hours or a few days.
Delirium can often be traced to one or more factors. Factors may include a severe or long illness or an imbalance in the body, such as low sodium. The disorder also may be caused by certain medicines, infection, surgery, or alcohol or drug use or withdrawal.
Symptoms of delirium are sometimes confused with symptoms of dementia. Health care providers may rely on input from a family member or caregiver to diagnose the disorder.","Symptoms of delirium usually begin over a few hours or a few days. They typically occur with a medical problem. Symptoms often come and go during the day. There may be periods of no symptoms.

Frontotemporal dementia,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is an umbrella term for a group of brain diseases that mainly affect the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. These areas of the brain are associated with personality, behavior and language.
In frontotemporal dementia, parts of these lobes shrink, known as atrophy. Symptoms depend on which part of the brain is affected. Some people with frontotemporal dementia have changes in their personalities. They become socially inappropriate and may be impulsive or emotionally indifferent. Others lose the ability to properly use language.
Frontotemporal dementia can be misdiagnosed as a mental health condition or as Alzheimer's disease. ButFTDtends to occur at a younger age than does Alzheimer's disease. It often begins between the ages of 40 and 65, although it can occur later in life as well.FTDis the cause of dementia about 10% to 20% of the time.","Symptoms of frontotemporal dementia differ from one person to the next.

Lewy body dementia,"Lewy body dementia is the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. Protein deposits called Lewy bodies develop in nerve cells in the brain. The protein deposits affect brain regions involved in thinking, memory and movement. This condition is also known as dementia with Lewy bodies.
Lewy body dementia causes a decline in mental abilities that gradually gets worse over time. People with Lewy body dementia might see things that aren't there. This is known as visual hallucinations. They also may have changes in alertness and attention.
People with Lewy body dementia might experience Parkinson's disease symptoms. These symptoms may include rigid muscles, slow movement, trouble walking and tremors.","Lewy body dementia symptoms can include: | Visual hallucinations.Seeing things that aren't there, known as hallucinations, might be one of the first symptoms of Lewy body dementia. This symptom often occurs regularly. People with Lewy body dementia might see shapes, animals or people that aren't there. Hallucinations involving sounds, smells or touch are possible. | Movement disorders.Signs of Parkinson's disease, known as parkinsonian signs, may occur. These symptoms include slowed movement, rigid muscles, tremor or a shuffling walk. This can cause the person to fall. | Poor regulation of body functions.The part of the nervous system that controls automatic functions is called the autonomic nervous system.

Dengue fever,"Dengue (DENG-gey) fever is a mosquito-borne illness that occurs in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Mild dengue fever causes a high fever and flu-like symptoms. The severe form of dengue fever, also called dengue hemorrhagic fever, can cause serious bleeding, a sudden drop in blood pressure (shock) and death.
Millions of cases of dengue infection occur worldwide each year. Dengue fever is most common in Southeast Asia, the western Pacific islands, Latin America and Africa. But the disease has been spreading to new areas, including local outbreaks in Europe and southern parts of the United States.
Researchers are working on dengue fever vaccines. For now, in areas where dengue fever is common, the best ways to prevent infection are to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes and to take steps to reduce the mosquito population.","Many people experience no signs or symptoms of a dengue infection. | When symptoms do occur, they may be mistaken for other illnesses — such as the flu — and usually begin four to 10 days after you are bitten by an infected mosquito. | Dengue fever causes a high fever — 104 F (40 C) — and any of the following signs and symptoms: | Headache | Muscle, bone or joint pain | Nausea | Vomiting | Pain behind the eyes | Swollen glands | Rash | Most people recover within a week or so. In some cases, symptoms worsen and can become life-threatening. This is called severe dengue, dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. | Severe dengue happens when your blood vessels become damaged and leaky. And the number of clot-forming cells (platelets) in your bloodstream drops. This can lead to shock, internal bleeding, organ failure and even death. | Warning signs of severe dengue fever — which is a life-threatening emergency — can develop quickly. The warning signs usually begin the first day or two after your fever goes away, and may include: | Severe stomach pain | Persistent vomiting | Bleeding from your gums or nose | Blood in your urine, stools or vomit | Bleeding under the skin, which might look like bruising | Difficult or rapid breathing | Fatigue | Irritability or restlessness",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dengue-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20353078
Nicotine dependence,"Nicotine dependence occurs when you need nicotine and can't stop using it. Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that makes it hard to quit. Nicotine produces pleasing effects in your brain, but these effects are temporary. So you reach for another cigarette.
The more you smoke, the more nicotine you need to feel good. When you try to stop, you experience unpleasant mental and physical changes. These are symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.
Regardless of how long you've smoked, stopping can improve your health. It isn't easy but you can break your dependence on nicotine. Many effective treatments are available. Ask your doctor for help.","For some people, using any amount of tobacco can quickly lead to nicotine dependence. Signs that you may be addicted include: | You can't stop smoking.You've made one or more serious, but unsuccessful, attempts to stop. | You have withdrawal symptoms when you try to stop.Your attempts at stopping have caused physical and mood-related symptoms, such as strong cravings, anxiety, irritability, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, depressed mood, frustration, anger, increased hunger, insomnia, constipation or diarrhea. | You keep smoking despite health problems.Even though you've developed health problems with your lungs or your heart, you haven't been able to stop. | You give up social activities.You may stop going to smoke-free restaurants or stop socializing with family or friends because you can't smoke in these situations.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nicotine-dependence/symptoms-causes/syc-20351584
Depersonalization-derealization disorder,"Depersonalization-derealization disorder occurs when you always or often feel that you're seeing yourself from outside your body or you sense that things around you are not real — or both. Feelings of depersonalization and derealization can be very disturbing. You may feel like you're living in a dream.
Many people have a passing experience of depersonalization or derealization at some point. But when these feelings keep occurring or never fully go away, and they make it hard for you to function, it's likely depersonalization-derealization disorder. This condition is more common in people who experience trauma, such as violence, abuse or other kinds of extreme stress.
Depersonalization-derealization disorder can be serious and may get in the way of your relationships and work. It also can disrupt other daily activities. The main treatment for depersonalization-derealization disorder is psychotherapy, also known as talk therapy. Sometimes medicines also are used.","Short experiences of depersonalization or derealization are fairly common. But lasting and returning bouts of these symptoms can cause problems at work or school, or in other important areas of your life. During these bouts, you know that your sense of not being connected to your body or your surroundings are only feelings and not reality. | The experience and feelings of the condition can be hard to describe. Worrying about ""going crazy"" can cause you to become focused on checking that you exist and finding out what's real. | Symptoms usually begin in the middle or late teenage years, or in early adulthood.

Depression (major depressive disorder),"Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. Also called major depressive disorder or clinical depression, it affects how you feel, think and behave and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. You may have trouble doing normal day-to-day activities, and sometimes you may feel as if life isn't worth living.
More than just a bout of the blues, depression isn't a weakness and you can't simply ""snap out"" of it. Depression may require long-term treatment. But don't get discouraged. Most people with depression feel better with medication, psychotherapy or both.","Although depression may occur only once during your life, people typically have multiple episodes. During these episodes, symptoms occur most of the day, nearly every day and may include: | Feelings of sadness, tearfulness, emptiness or hopelessness | Angry outbursts, irritability or frustration, even over small matters | Loss of interest or pleasure in most or all normal activities, such as sex, hobbies or sports | Sleep disturbances, including insomnia or sleeping too much | Tiredness and lack of energy, so even small tasks take extra effort | Reduced appetite and weight loss or increased cravings for food and weight gain | Anxiety, agitation or restlessness | Slowed thinking, speaking or body movements | Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or self-blame | Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things | Frequent or recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts or suicide | Unexplained physical problems, such as back pain or headaches | For many people with depression, symptoms usually are severe enough to cause noticeable problems in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships with others. Some people may feel generally miserable or unhappy without really knowing why.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007
Postpartum depression,"The birth of a baby can start a variety of powerful emotions, from excitement and joy to fear and anxiety. But it can also result in something you might not expect — depression.
Most new moms experience postpartum ""baby blues"" after childbirth, which commonly include mood swings, crying spells, anxiety and difficulty sleeping. Baby blues usually begin within the first 2 to 3 days after delivery and may last for up to two weeks.
But some new moms experience a more severe, long-lasting form of depression known as postpartum depression. Sometimes it's called peripartum depression because it can start during pregnancy and continue after childbirth. Rarely, an extreme mood disorder called postpartum psychosis also may develop after childbirth.
Postpartum depression is not a character flaw or a weakness. Sometimes it's simply a complication of giving birth. If you have postpartum depression, prompt treatment can help you manage your symptoms and help you bond with your baby.","Symptoms of depression after childbirth vary, and they can range from mild to severe.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/postpartum-depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20376617
Teen depression,"Teen depression is a serious mental health problem that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest in activities. It affects how your teenager thinks, feels and behaves, and it can cause emotional, functional and physical problems. Although depression can occur at any time in life, symptoms may be different between teens and adults.
Issues such as peer pressure, academic expectations and changing bodies can bring a lot of ups and downs for teens. But for some teens, the lows are more than just temporary feelings — they're a symptom of depression.
Teen depression isn't a weakness or something that can be overcome with willpower — it can have serious consequences and requires long-term treatment. For most teens, depression symptoms ease with treatment such as medication and psychological counseling.","Teen depression signs and symptoms include a change from the teenager's previous attitude and behavior that can cause significant distress and problems at school or home, in social activities, or in other areas of life. | Depression symptoms can vary in severity, but changes in your teen's emotions and behavior may include the examples below.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/teen-depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20350985

Swimmer's itch,"Swimmer's itch is a rash that can occur after you go swimming or wading outdoors. It's most common after being in freshwater lakes and ponds, but you can get it in saltwater too.
Swimmer's itch is usually caused by a reaction to tiny parasites in the water that burrow into your skin while you're swimming or wading in warm, calm water. These parasites can't survive in people, so they soon die.
Swimmer's itch usually clears on its own within a few days. In the meantime, you can control itching with medicine.","Swimmer's itch symptoms include an itchy rash that looks like pimples or blisters. Symptoms may begin within minutes or as long as two days after swimming or wading in contaminated water. | Usually the rash affects skin that's not covered by swimsuits, wetsuits or waders.

Contact dermatitis,"Contact dermatitis is an itchy rash caused by direct contact with a substance or an allergic reaction to it. The rash isn't contagious, but it can be very uncomfortable.
Many substances can cause this reaction, such as cosmetics, fragrances, jewelry and plants. The rash often shows up within days of exposure.
To treat contact dermatitis successfully, you need to identify and avoid the cause of your reaction. If you avoid the substance causing the reaction, the rash often clears up in 2 to 4 weeks. You can try soothing your skin with a cool, wet cloth and other self-care steps.","Contact dermatitis shows up on skin that has been directly exposed to the substance causing the reaction. For example, the rash may show up along a leg that brushed against poison ivy. The rash can develop within minutes to hours of exposure, and it can last 2 to 4 weeks. | Signs and symptoms of contact dermatitis vary widely and may include: | An itchy rash | Leathery patches that are darker than usual (hyperpigmented), typically on brown or Black skin | Dry, cracked, scaly skin, typically on white skin | Bumps and blisters, sometimes with oozing and crusting | Swelling, burning or tenderness",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/contact-dermatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352742
Neurodermatitis,"Neurodermatitis is a skin condition that starts with an itchy patch of skin. Scratching makes it itch more. With more scratching, the skin becomes thick and leathery. You may develop several itchy spots, typically on the neck, wrists, forearms, legs or groin area.
Neurodermatitis — also known as lichen simplex chronicus — is not life-threatening or contagious. But the itching can be so intense it disrupts your sleep, sexual function and quality of life.
Breaking the itch-scratch cycle of neurodermatitis is challenging, and neurodermatitis is usually a long-term condition. It may clear up with treatment but often returns. Treatment focuses on controlling the itching and preventing scratching. It also may help to identify and eliminate factors that worsen your symptoms, such as dry skin.","Symptoms of neurodermatitis include: | An itchy, scaly skin patch or patches | Open sores that bleed | Thick, leathery skin | Discolored, wrinkled genital skin | Raised, rough patches that are inflamed or darker than the rest of the skin | The condition involves areas that can be reached for scratching — the scalp, neck, wrists, forearms, ankles, vulva, scrotum and anus.

Seborrheic dermatitis,"Seborrheic (seb-o-REE-ik) dermatitis is a common skin condition that mainly affects your scalp. It causes scaly patches, inflamed skin and stubborn dandruff. It usually affects oily areas of the body, such as the face, sides of the nose, eyebrows, ears, eyelids and chest. This condition can be irritating but it's not contagious, and it doesn't cause permanent hair loss.
Seborrheic dermatitis may go away without treatment. Or you may need to use medicated shampoo or other products long term to clear up symptoms and prevent flare-ups.
Seborrheic dermatitis is also called dandruff, seborrheic eczema and seborrheic psoriasis. When it occurs in infants, it's called cradle cap.","Seborrheic dermatitis signs and symptoms may include: | Flaking skin (dandruff) on your scalp, hair, eyebrows, beard or mustache | Patches of greasy skin covered with flaky white or yellow scales or crust on the scalp, face, sides of the nose, eyebrows, ears, eyelids, chest, armpits, groin area or under the breasts | Rash that may look darker or lighter in people with brown or Black skin and redder in those with white skin | Ring-shaped (annular) rash, for a type called petaloid seborrheic dermatitis | Itchiness (pruritus) | The signs and symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis tend to flare with stress, fatigue or a change of season.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seborrheic-dermatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352710
Dermatographia (Dermatographism),"Dermatographia is a condition in which lightly scratching your skin causes raised, inflamed lines or welts. These marks tend to go away in less than 30 minutes. The condition is also known as dermatographism and skin writing.
The cause of dermatographia is unknown, but it may be related to an infection, emotional upset or a medicine you're taking.

Retinal detachment,"Retinal detachment happens when the thin layer of tissue at the back of the eye pulls away from its regular position. This layer of tissue is called the retina. Retinal detachment is an emergency.
Retinal detachment separates the retinal cells from the layer of blood vessels that provides oxygen and nourishment to the eye. The longer retinal detachment goes without treatment, the greater the risk of permanent vision loss in the affected eye.
Symptoms of retinal detachment can include the following: reduced vision, the sudden appearance of dark floating shapes and flashes of light in your vision, and loss of side vision. Contacting an eye doctor, called an ophthalmologist, right away can help save your vision.","Retinal detachment is painless. Often, symptoms are present before a retinal detachment happens or before it has gotten worse. You may notice symptoms such as: | The sudden appearance of tiny specks or squiggly lines that seem to drift through your field of vision.

Neuromyelitis optica,"Neuromyelitis optica, also known as NMO, is a central nervous system disorder that causes inflammation in nerves of the eye and the spinal cord.
NMOalso is called neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and Devic disease. It occurs when the immune system reacts against the body's own cells. This happens mainly in the spinal cord and in the optic nerves that connect the retina of the eye with the brain. But it sometimes happens in the brain.
The condition may appear after an infection, or it can be linked with another autoimmune condition. Altered antibodies bind to proteins in the central nervous system and cause damage.
Neuromyelitis optica is often misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis, also known as MS, or is seen as a type ofMS. ButNMOis a different condition.
Neuromyelitis optica can cause blindness, weakness in the legs or arms, and painful spasms. It also can cause loss of sensation, vomiting and hiccups, and bladder or bowel symptoms.
Symptoms can get better and then worse again, known as a relapse. Treatment to prevent relapses is important to help prevent disability.NMOcan cause permanent vision loss and trouble walking.","Symptoms of neuromyelitis optica are related to the inflammation that occurs in the nerves of the eye and spinal cord. | Vision changes caused byNMOare called optic neuritis. These may include: | Blurred vision or loss of vision in one or both eyes. | Not being able to see color. | Eye pain. | Symptoms related to the spinal cord are called transverse myelitis.

Diabetes,"Diabetes mellitus refers to a group of diseases that affect how the body uses blood sugar (glucose). Glucose is an important source of energy for the cells that make up the muscles and tissues. It's also the brain's main source of fuel.
The main cause of diabetes varies by type. But no matter what type of diabetes you have, it can lead to excess sugar in the blood. Too much sugar in the blood can lead to serious health problems.
Chronic diabetes conditions include type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Potentially reversible diabetes conditions include prediabetes and gestational diabetes. Prediabetes happens when blood sugar levels are higher than normal. But the blood sugar levels aren't high enough to be called diabetes. And prediabetes can lead to diabetes unless steps are taken to prevent it. Gestational diabetes happens during pregnancy. But it may go away after the baby is born.","Diabetes symptoms depend on how high your blood sugar is. Some people, especially if they haveprediabetes,gestational diabetesortype 2 diabetes, may not have symptoms. Intype 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe. | Some of the symptoms of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are: | Feeling more thirsty than usual. | Urinating often. | Losing weight without trying. | Presence of ketones in the urine. Ketones are a byproduct of the breakdown of muscle and fat that happens when there's not enough available insulin. | Feeling tired and weak. | Feeling irritable or having other mood changes. | Having blurry vision. | Having slow-healing sores. | Getting a lot of infections, such as gum, skin and vaginal infections. | Type 1 diabetes can start at any age. But it often startsduring childhoodor teen years. Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age. Type 2 diabetes is more common in people older than 40.

Diabetes insipidus,"Diabetes insipidus (die-uh-BEE-teze in-SIP-uh-dus) is an uncommon problem that causes the fluids in the body to become out of balance. That prompts the body to make large amounts of urine. It also causes a feeling of being very thirsty even after having something to drink. Diabetes insipidus also is called arginine vasopressin deficiency and arginine vasopressin resistance.
While the terms ""diabetes insipidus"" and ""diabetes mellitus"" sound alike, the two conditions are not connected. Diabetes mellitus involves high blood sugar levels. It's a common condition, and it's often called simply diabetes.
There's no cure for diabetes insipidus. But treatment is available that can ease its symptoms. That includes relieving thirst, lowering the amount of urine the body makes and preventing dehydration.","Symptoms of diabetes insipidus in adults include: | Being very thirsty, often with a preference for cold water. | Making large amounts of pale urine. | Getting up to urinate and drink water often during the night. | Adults typically urinate an average of 1 to 3 quarts (about 1 to 3 liters) a day. People who have diabetes insipidus and who drink a lot of fluids may make as much as 20 quarts (about 19 liters) of urine a day. | A baby or young child who has diabetes insipidus may have these symptoms: | Large amounts of pale urine that result in heavy, wet diapers. | Bed-wetting. | Being very thirsty, with a preference for drinking water and cold liquids. | Weight loss. | Poor growth. | Vomiting. | Irritability. | Fever. | Constipation. | Headache. | Problems sleeping. | Vision problems.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes-insipidus/symptoms-causes/syc-20351269

Type 1 diabetes,"Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition. In this condition, the pancreas makes little or no insulin. Insulin is a hormone the body uses to allow sugar (glucose) to enter cells to produce energy.
Different factors, such as genetics and some viruses, may cause type 1 diabetes. Although type 1 diabetes usually appears during childhood or adolescence, it can develop in adults.
Even after a lot of research, type 1 diabetes has no cure. Treatment is directed toward managing the amount of sugar in the blood using insulin, diet and lifestyle to prevent complications.",Type 1 diabetes symptoms can appear suddenly and may include: | Feeling more thirsty than usual | Urinating a lot | Bed-wetting in children who have never wet the bed during the night | Feeling very hungry | Losing weight without trying | Feeling irritable or having other mood changes | Feeling tired and weak | Having blurry vision,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-1-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20353011
Type 1 diabetes in children,"Type 1 diabetes in children is a condition in which your child's body no longer produces an important hormone (insulin). Your child needs insulin to survive, so the missing insulin needs to be replaced with injections or with an insulin pump. Type 1 diabetes in children used to be known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes.
The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children can be overwhelming, especially in the beginning. Suddenly you and your child — depending on your child's age — must learn how to give injections, count carbohydrates and monitor blood sugar.
There's no cure for type 1 diabetes in children, but it can be managed. Advances in blood sugar monitoring and insulin delivery have improved blood sugar management and quality of life for children with type 1 diabetes.","The signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes in children usually develop quickly, and may include: | Increased thirst | Frequent urination, possibly bed-wetting in a toilet-trained child | Extreme hunger | Unintentional weight loss | Fatigue | Irritability or behavior changes | Fruity-smelling breath",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-1-diabetes-in-children/symptoms-causes/syc-20355306
Type 2 diabetes,"Type 2 diabetes happens when the body cannot use insulin correctly and sugar builds up in the blood. It was once called adult-onset diabetes.
Over time, high blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes can damage the eyes, kidneys, nerves and heart. This can happen because the pancreas doesn't make enough of a hormone called insulin that helps sugar enter the cells. It happens also because the cells respond poorly to insulin by taking in less sugar.
Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can begin during childhood and adulthood. Type 2 is more common in older adults. But the increase in the number of children with obesity has led to more young people with type 2 diabetes.
There's no cure for type 2 diabetes. Losing weight, eating well and exercising can help manage the condition. If diet and exercise aren't enough to manage blood sugar, diabetes medicines or insulin therapy may help.","Symptoms of type 2 diabetes often come on slowly. In fact, people can live with type 2 diabetes for years and not know it. When there are symptoms, they may include: | More thirst. | More urination. | More hunger. | Weight loss. | Tiredness. | Blurred vision. | Slow-healing sores. | Frequent infections. | Numbness or tingling in the hands or feet. | Areas of darkened skin, most often in the armpits and neck.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20351193

Type 2 diabetes occurs more commonly in adults. In fact, it used to be called adult-onset diabetes. But the increasing number of children with obesity has led to more cases of type 2 diabetes in younger people.
There's plenty you can do to help manage or prevent type 2 diabetes in your child. Encourage your child to eat healthy foods, get plenty of physical activity and maintain a healthy weight. If healthy eating and exercise aren't enough to control type 2 diabetes, oral medication or insulin treatment may be needed.","Type 2 diabetes in children may develop so gradually that there are no noticeable symptoms.

Diabetic nephropathy affects the kidneys' usual work of removing waste products and extra fluid from the body. The best way to prevent or delay diabetic nephropathy is by living a healthy lifestyle and keeping diabetes and high blood pressure managed.
Over years, diabetic nephropathy slowly damages the kidneys' filtering system. Early treatment may prevent this condition or slow it and lower the chance of complications.
Diabetic kidney disease can lead to kidney failure. This also is called end-stage kidney disease. Kidney failure is a life-threatening condition. Treatment options for kidney failure are dialysis or a kidney transplant.","In the early stages of diabetic nephropathy, there might not be symptoms.

When you visit a place where the climate or sanitary practices are different from yours at home, you have an increased risk of developing traveler's diarrhea.
To reduce your risk of traveler's diarrhea, be careful about what you eat and drink while traveling. If you do develop traveler's diarrhea, chances are it will go away without treatment. However, it's a good idea to have doctor-approved medicines with you when you travel to high-risk areas. This way, you'll be prepared in case diarrhea gets severe or won't go away.","Traveler's diarrhea may begin suddenly during your trip or shortly after you return home.

DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome),"DiGeorge syndrome, also known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, is a condition caused when a small part of chromosome 22 is missing. This deletion causes several body systems to develop poorly.
The term 22q11.2 deletion syndrome covers terms once thought to be different conditions. These terms include DiGeorge syndrome, velocardiofacial (vel-oh-cahr-dee-oh-fay-shell) syndrome and other conditions caused by the same missing part of chromosome 22. But features may vary slightly.
Medical problems commonly related to 22q11.2 deletion syndrome include heart problems, lowered immunity, a cleft palate, complications from low levels of calcium, various eye issues and autoimmune disorders. Complications also include hearing loss, skeletal differences, kidney and genital differences, and delayed development with behavioral and emotional problems.
The number and severity of symptoms related to 22q11.2 deletion syndrome vary. But specialists in various fields need to treat almost everyone with this syndrome.","Symptoms of DiGeorge syndrome can vary based on what body systems are affected and the severity of the problems. Some symptoms may be clear at birth, but others may not appear until later in infancy or as a young child, or as an adult. | Symptoms of DiGeorge syndrome may include: | Heart issues, such as problems with the structure of the heart and vessels, or a heart murmur and bluish skin because of poor circulation of blood, also known as cyanosis. | Frequent infections. | Distinctive facial features, such as an underdeveloped chin, ears that look different, wide-set eyes, hooded eyes and an enlarged nose tip. Asymmetric crying facies also may be present. This is when muscles on one side of the mouth don't develop fully, causing that side of the mouth to droop when crying, though the face looks balanced at rest. | A gap in the roof of the mouth, also known as a cleft palate, or other problems with the palate. | A hard time feeding, failure to gain weight or stomach problems. | Hearing loss. | Poor muscle tone. | Kidney problems. | Poor vision and other eye problems. | Low levels of calcium in the blood. | Scoliosis. | Other symptoms may include: | Delayed growth. | Delayed development, such as delays in rolling over, sitting up or other infant milestones. | Delayed speech development or nasal-sounding speech. | Learning delays or disabilities. | Behavioral problems. | Other conditions may cause symptoms like 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. It's important to get the right diagnosis quickly if your child shows any symptoms listed above. | Healthcare professionals may suspect 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: | At birth.If a severe heart problem, cleft palate or other signs typical of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are clear at birth, tests likely will be done before your child leaves the hospital. | At well-baby visits.Illnesses or conditions that are typical of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome may become clear over time. Your child's healthcare professional may see issues during regularly scheduled well-baby visits or annual checkups.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/digeorge-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20353543

Dislocated shoulder,"A dislocated shoulder is an injury in which the upper arm bone pops out of the cup-shaped socket that's part of the shoulder blade. The shoulder is the body's most flexible joint, which makes it more likely to dislocate.
If you suspect a dislocated shoulder, seek prompt medical attention. Most people regain full use of their shoulder within a few weeks. However, once a shoulder dislocates, the joint might be prone to repeat dislocations.","Dislocated shoulder symptoms can include: | A visibly deformed or out-of-place shoulder | Swelling or bruising | Intense pain | Inability to move the joint | Shoulder dislocation can also cause numbness, weakness or tingling near the injury, such as in the neck or down the arm. The muscles in the shoulder might spasm, which can increase the pain.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dislocated-shoulder/symptoms-causes/syc-20371715

Dissociative disorders,"Dissociative disorders are mental health conditions that involve experiencing a loss of connection between thoughts, memories, feelings, surroundings, behavior and identity. These conditions include escape from reality in ways that are not wanted and not healthy. This causes problems in managing everyday life.
Dissociative disorders usually arise as a reaction to shocking, distressing or painful events and help push away difficult memories. Symptoms depend in part on the type of dissociative disorder and can range from memory loss to disconnected identities. Times of stress can worsen symptoms for a while, making them easier to see.
Treatment for dissociative disorders may include talk therapy, also called psychotherapy, and medicine. Treating dissociative disorders can be difficult, but many people learn new ways of coping and their lives get better.","Symptoms depend on the type of dissociative disorder, but may include: |  | A sense of being separated from yourself and your emotions. | Thinking that people and things around you are distorted and not real. | A blurred sense of your own identity. | Severe stress or problems in relationships, work or other important areas of life. | Not being able to cope well with emotional or work-related stress. | Memory loss, also called amnesia, of certain time periods, events, people and personal information. | Mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. | The American Psychiatric Association defines three major dissociative disorders: Depersonalization/derealization disorder, dissociative amnesia, and dissociative identity disorder.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dissociative-disorders/symptoms-causes/syc-20355215
Diverticulitis,"Diverticulitis is inflammation of irregular bulging pouches in the wall of the large intestine.
Typically, the wall of the large intestine, also called the colon, is smooth. An irregular, bulging pouch in the colon wall is called a diverticulum. Multiple pouches are called diverticula.
Diverticula are common, especially after age 50. They are usually found in the lower part of the colon. Most often, they don't cause problems. The presence of diverticula is called diverticulosis. Diverticulosis isn't a disease condition.
When these pouches become inflamed, the condition is called diverticulitis. Inflammation is immune system activity that increases blood flow and fluids to a site in the body and delivers disease-fighting cells. Inflammation of diverticula can cause severe pain, fever, nausea and changes in your stool habits.
Mild diverticulitis is usually treated with rest, changes in your diet and possibly antibiotics. Severe diverticulitis usually needs antibiotic treatment in the hospital. Surgery may be needed for severe or frequent diverticulitis.","A common symptom of diverticulitis is pain in the area below the chest called the abdomen. Most often, pain is in the lower left abdomen. | Pain from diverticulitis is usually sudden and intense. Pain may be mild and gradually worsen, or the intensity of the pain may vary over time. | Other signs and symptoms of diverticulitis may include: | Nausea. | Fever. | Tenderness in the abdomen when touched. | Changes in stool, including sudden diarrhea or constipation.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diverticulitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20371758
Dizziness,"Dizziness is a term that people use to describe a range of sensations, such as feeling faint, woozy, weak or wobbly. The sense that you or your surroundings are spinning or moving is more precisely termed vertigo.
Dizziness is one of the more common reasons adults see a healthcare professional. Frequent dizzy spells or constant dizziness can have serious effects on your life. But dizziness rarely means that you have a life-threatening condition.
Treatment of dizziness depends on the cause and your symptoms. Treatment often helps, but the symptoms may come back.","People who have bouts of dizziness may describe symptoms such as: | A sense of motion or spinning, also called vertigo. | Lightheadedness or feeling faint. | A loss of balance or the sense of not feeling steady. | A feeling of floating, wooziness or heavy-headedness. | These feelings may be triggered or made worse by walking, standing up or moving your head. Your dizziness may happen along with an upset stomach. Or your dizziness may be so sudden or severe that you need to sit or lie down. The bout may last seconds or days, and it may come back.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dizziness/symptoms-causes/syc-20371787
Down syndrome,"Down syndrome is a genetic condition caused when an unusual cell division results in an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 21. This extra genetic material causes the developmental changes and physical features of Down syndrome.
The term ""syndrome"" refers to a set of symptoms that tend to happen together. With a syndrome, there is a pattern of differences or problems. The condition is named after an English physician, John Langdon Down, who first described it.
Down syndrome varies in severity among individuals. The condition causes lifelong intellectual disability and developmental delays. It's the most common genetic chromosomal cause of intellectual disabilities in children. It also commonly causes other medical conditions, including heart and digestive system problems.
Better understanding of Down syndrome and early interventions can greatly improve the quality of life for children and adults with this condition and help them live fulfilling lives.","Each person with Down syndrome is an individual. Problems with intellect and development are usually mild to moderate. Some people are healthy while others have serious health issues such as heart problems that are present at birth. | Children and adults with Down syndrome have distinct face and body features. Though not all people with Down syndrome have the same features, some of the more common features include: | Flattened face and small nose with a flat bridge. | Small head. | Short neck. | Tongue that tends to stick out of the mouth. | Upward slanting eyelids. | Skin fold of the upper eyelid that covers the inner corner of the eye. | Small, rounded ears. | Wide, small hands with a single crease in the palm and short fingers. | Small feet with a space between the first and second toes. | Tiny white spots on the colored part of the eye called the iris. These white spots are called Brushfield's spots. | Short height. | Poor muscle tone in infancy. | Joints that are loose and too flexible. | Infants with Down syndrome may be average size, but typically they grow slowly and remain shorter than other children the same age.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/down-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20355977
Dressler syndrome,"Dressler syndrome is swelling and irritation of the sac around the heart that happens after damage to the heart muscle. The damage may trigger an immune system response that causes the condition. The damage can result from a heart attack, heart surgery or a serious injury.
Symptoms of Dressler syndrome include chest pain that can feel like chest pain from a heart attack.
Swelling and irritation of the sac around the heart is called pericarditis. Dressler syndrome is a type of pericarditis that can start after the heart muscle is damaged. So you may hear Dressler syndrome called post-traumatic pericarditis.
Some other names for the condition are:","Symptoms of Dressler syndrome are likely to start weeks to a few months after a heart attack, surgery or injury to the chest. Symptoms can include: | Chest pain, which may get worse with deep breaths. | Fever. | Shortness of breath.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dresslers-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20371811
Foot drop,"Foot drop, sometimes called drop foot, is a general term for difficulty lifting the front part of the foot. If you have foot drop, the front of your foot might drag on the ground when you walk.
Foot drop isn't a disease. Rather, it is a sign of an underlying neurological, muscular or anatomical problem.
Sometimes foot drop is temporary, but it can be permanent. If you have foot drop, you might need to wear a brace on your ankle and foot to support the foot and hold it in position.","Foot drop makes it difficult to lift the front part of the foot, so it might drag on the floor when you walk. To help the foot clear the floor, a person with foot drop may raise the thigh more than usual when walking, as though climbing stairs. This unusual kind of walking, called steppage gait, might cause the foot to slap down onto the floor with each step. In some cases, the skin on the top of the foot and toes feels numb. | Depending on the cause, foot drop can affect one or both feet.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/foot-drop/symptoms-causes/syc-20372628
Drug addiction (substance use disorder),"Drug addiction, also called substance use disorder, is a disease that affects a person's brain and behavior and leads to an inability to control the use of a legal or illegal drug or medicine. Substances such as alcohol, marijuana and nicotine also are considered drugs. When you're addicted, you may continue using the drug despite the harm it causes.
Drug addiction can start with experimental use of a recreational drug in social situations, and, for some people, the drug use becomes more frequent. For others, particularly with opioids, drug addiction begins when they take prescribed medicines or receive them from others who have prescriptions.
The risk of addiction and how fast you become addicted varies by drug. Some drugs, such as opioid painkillers, have a higher risk and cause addiction more quickly than others.
As time passes, you may need larger doses of the drug to get high. Soon you may need the drug just to feel good. As your drug use increases, you may find that it's increasingly difficult to go without the drug. Attempts to stop drug use may cause intense cravings and make you feel physically ill. These are called withdrawal symptoms.
Help from your health care provider, family, friends, support groups or an organized treatment program can help you overcome your drug addiction and stay drug-free.","Drug addiction symptoms or behaviors include, among others: | Feeling that you have to use the drug regularly — daily or even several times a day | Having intense urges for the drug that block out any other thoughts | Over time, needing more of the drug to get the same effect | Taking larger amounts of the drug over a longer period of time than you intended | Making certain that you maintain a supply of the drug | Spending money on the drug, even though you can't afford it | Not meeting obligations and work responsibilities, or cutting back on social or recreational activities because of drug use | Continuing to use the drug, even though you know it's causing problems in your life or causing you physical or psychological harm | Doing things to get the drug that you normally wouldn't do, such as stealing | Driving or doing other risky activities when you're under the influence of the drug | Spending a good deal of time getting the drug, using the drug or recovering from the effects of the drug | Failing in your attempts to stop using the drug | Experiencing withdrawal symptoms when you attempt to stop taking the drug",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/drug-addiction/symptoms-causes/syc-20365112
Drug allergy,"A drug allergy is the reaction of the immune system to a medicine. Any medicine — over-the-counter, prescription or herbal — can trigger a drug allergy. However, a drug allergy is more likely with certain medicines.
The most common symptoms of drug allergy are hives, rash and fever. But a drug allergy also may cause serious reactions. This includes a severe, life-threatening condition known as anaphylaxis.
A drug allergy is not the same as a medicine side effect. A side effect is a known possible reaction to a medicine. Side effects to medicines are listed on their labels. A drug allergy also is different from drug toxicity. Drug toxicity is caused by an overdose of medicine.","Symptoms of a serious drug allergy often happen within an hour after taking a medicine. Other reactions, particularly rashes, can happen hours, days or weeks later. | Drug allergy symptoms may include: | Skin rash. | Hives. | Itching. | Fever. | Swelling. | Shortness of breath. | Wheezing. | Runny nose. | Itchy, watery eyes.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/drug-allergy/symptoms-causes/syc-20371835
Dry macular degeneration,"Dry macular degeneration is an eye condition that causes blurred vision or reduced central vision. It is caused by the breakdown of a part of the retina known as the macula (MAK-u-luh). The macula is responsible for central vision. This condition is common among people over 50.
Dry macular degeneration may start in one eye then develop in the other eye. It also may develop in both eyes at the same time. Over time, vision may worsen and affect the ability to do things, such as read, drive and recognize faces. But having dry macular degeneration doesn't mean you'll lose all your sight. Vision loss is typically central, and people retain their side vision. Some people have only mild central vision loss. In others, it can be more severe.
Early detection and self-care measures may delay vision loss caused by dry macular degeneration.","Dry macular degeneration symptoms usually develop gradually and without pain. They may include: | Visual distortions, such as straight lines seeming bent. | Reduced central vision in one or both eyes. | The need for brighter light when reading or doing close-up work. | Increased difficulty adapting to low light levels, such as when entering a dimly lit restaurant or theater. | Increased blurriness of printed words. | Difficulty recognizing faces. | A well-defined blurry spot or blind spot in the field of vision. | Dry macular degeneration can affect one or both eyes. If only one eye is affected, you may not notice any changes in your vision. This is because your good eye may compensate for the affected eye. And the condition doesn't affect the side vision, so it does not cause total blindness. | Dry macular degeneration is one of two types of age-related macular degeneration. It can progress to wet macular degeneration, which is when blood vessels grow and leak under the retina. The dry type is more common, but it usually progresses slowly over years. The wet type is more likely to cause a relatively sudden change in vision resulting in serious vision loss.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dry-macular-degeneration/symptoms-causes/syc-20350375
Dry mouth,"Dry mouth, also called xerostomia (zeer-o-STOE-me-uh), is when the salivary glands in the mouth don't make enough saliva to keep the mouth wet. Dry mouth often is due to aging, the side effects of certain medicines or radiation therapy for cancer. Less often, a condition directly affecting the salivary glands can cause dry mouth. You also may experience dry mouth temporarily if you are thirsty or feel anxious about something.
For some people, dry mouth is only annoying. For others, dry mouth can greatly affect general health and the health of teeth and gums. Also, it can affect how much people eat and how much they enjoy what they eat.
Treatment for dry mouth depends on the cause.","If you're not producing enough saliva, you may notice these symptoms all or most of the time: | Dryness or a feeling of stickiness in your mouth. | Saliva that seems thick and stringy. | Bad breath. | Having a hard time chewing, speaking and swallowing. | Dry or sore throat and hoarseness. | Dry or grooved tongue. | A changed sense of taste. | Problems wearing dentures. | Lipstick stuck to teeth. | Saliva helps prevent tooth decay by washing away sugar and food particles and making bacteria neutral and less harmful. When you don't have enough saliva, you may find it harder to taste, chew and swallow. You also may have a hard time digesting food.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dry-mouth/symptoms-causes/syc-20356048
Dry skin,"Dry skin makes the skin look and feel rough, itchy, flaky or scaly. The location where these dry patches form vary from person to person. It's a common condition that affects people of all ages.
Dry skin, also known as xerosis or xeroderma, has many causes, including cold or dry weather, sun damage, harsh soaps, and overbathing.
You can do a lot on your own to improve dry skin, including moisturizing and practicing sun protection year-round. Try various products and skin care routines to find an approach that works for you.","Dry skin is often temporary or seasonal — you might get it only in winter, for example — or you might need to treat it long term. Signs and symptoms of dry skin might vary based on your age, health status, skin tone, living environment and sun exposure. They include: | A feeling of skin tightness | Skin that feels and looks rough | Itchiness (pruritus) | Slight to severe flaking skin, which causes the ashy look that can affect dry brown and black skin | Slight to severe scaling or peeling | Cracked ""dry riverbed"" look to leg | Fine lines or cracks | Skin that ranges from reddish on white skin to grayish on brown and black skin | Deep cracks that may bleed",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dry-skin/symptoms-causes/syc-20353885
Dry socket,"Dry socket is a painful dental condition that sometimes happens after you have a tooth removed. Having a tooth removed is called an extraction. Dry socket happens when a blood clot at the site where the tooth was removed does not form, comes out or dissolves before the wound has healed.
Usually a blood clot forms at the site where a tooth was removed. This blood clot is a protective layer over the underlying bone and nerve endings in the empty tooth socket. Also, the clot contains cells that are needed for proper healing of the site.
Intense pain happens when the underlying bone and nerves are exposed. Pain occurs in the socket and along the nerves to the side of the face. The socket becomes swollen and irritated. It may fill with bits of food, making the pain worse. If you get a dry socket, the pain usually begins 1 to 3 days after the tooth removal.
Dry socket is the most common complication following tooth removals, such as the removal of third molars, also called wisdom teeth. Medicine you can buy without a prescription usually will not be enough to treat dry socket pain. Your dentist or oral surgeon can offer treatments to relieve your pain.","Symptoms of dry socket may include: | Severe pain within a few days after removing a tooth. | Loss of part or all of the blood clot at the tooth removal site. The socket may look empty. | Bone that you can see in the socket. | Pain that spreads from the socket to your ear, eye, temple or neck on the same side of your face as the tooth removal. | Bad breath or a foul odor coming from your mouth. | Bad taste in your mouth.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dry-socket/symptoms-causes/syc-20354376

Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS),"Median arcuate ligament syndrome, also called MALS, happens when the band of tissue in the upper belly area presses on the artery that sends blood to the stomach, spleen and liver. This tissue is called the median arcuate ligament. The artery is called the celiac artery.
The median arcuate ligament creates a pathway between the chest and belly area for the body's main blood vessel, called the aorta. Typically, the ligament goes across the aorta. The celiac artery sits just below the arch.
But sometimes, the ligament or arteries may be out of place. The ligament may put pressure on the celiac artery and the network of surrounding nerves, called the celiac plexus. This pressure can cause the symptoms ofMALS. The condition can cause serious stomach pain in some people.
MALScan occur in anyone, even children. Other names forMALSare:
Treatment involves surgery to release pressure from the ligament on the artery and nerves.",Pressure on the celiac artery doesn't always cause symptoms.MALSsymptoms are mainly caused by pressure on the nerves. | Symptoms ofMALSinclude: | Stomach pain after eating or exercising. | The stomach pain gets better by leaning forward or backward or standing while eating. | Fear of eating food because of pain. | Unintended weight loss. | Bloating. | Diarrhea. | Nausea and vomiting.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/median-arcuate-ligament-syndrome-mals/symptoms-causes/syc-20505001
Dupuytren contracture,"Dupuytren contracture is a condition that causes one or more fingers to bend toward the palm of the hand. The affected fingers can't straighten completely.
Knots of tissue form under the skin. They eventually create a thick cord that can pull the fingers into a bent position. The condition gradually gets worse with time.
Dupuytren contracture most often affects the two fingers farthest from the thumb. This can complicate everyday activities such as placing your hands in your pockets, putting on gloves or shaking hands.
There's no cure for Dupuytren contracture. Treatments can relieve symptoms and slow how quickly the condition gets worse.","Dupuytren contracture gets worse slowly, over years. The condition begins with a firm lump in the palm of the hand. This lump can be painful or painless. | Over time, the lump can extend into a hard cord under the skin and up into the finger. This cord tightens and pulls the finger toward the palm, sometimes severely. | Dupuytren contracture most commonly affects the two fingers farthest from the thumb. The condition often occurs in both hands.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dupuytrens-contracture/symptoms-causes/syc-20371943
Dural arteriovenous fistulas,"Dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) are irregular connections between arteries and veins. They occur in the tough covering over the brain or spinal cord, known as the dura mater. The irregular passageways between arteries and veins are called arteriovenous fistulas, which can lead to bleeding in the brain or other serious symptoms.
DuralAVFsare rare. They tend to occur between ages 50 and 60. They are not typically genetic, so children are not more likely to develop adAVFif their parent has one.
Although somedAVFsstem from known causes, most often the cause is not known. It's thought thatdAVFsinvolving large brain veins form when one of the brain's venous sinuses narrows or becomes blocked. Venous sinuses are channels that route circulated blood from the brain back to the heart.
Treatment fordAVFusually involves an endovascular procedure or stereotactic radiosurgery to block the blood flow to thedAVF. Or surgery may be needed to disconnect or remove thedAVF.","Some people with dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) may not have symptoms. When symptoms occur, they may be characterized as benign or aggressive. An aggressivedAVFhas more-serious symptoms. | AggressivedAVFsymptomscan result from bleeding in the brain, known as intracerebral hemorrhage. Bleeding in the brain often causes a sudden headache. It also may cause other symptoms based on the location and size of the hemorrhage. | Aggressive symptoms also may result from nonhemorrhagic neurological deficits (NHNDs), which can include seizures or changes in mental abilities. These symptoms usually develop more gradually, over days to weeks. Symptoms are typically related to the area of the brain affected. | Aggressive symptoms can include: | Sudden headache. | Trouble walking and falls. | Seizures. | Speech or language issues. | Facial pain. | Dementia. | Slowed movement, stiffness and tremor, known as parkinsonism. | Trouble with coordination. | Burning or prickling sensations. | Weakness. | Lack of interest, known as apathy. | Failure to thrive. | Symptoms related to increased pressure, such as headaches, nausea and vomiting. | OtherdAVFsymptomscan include hearing issues. People with hearing symptoms may hear a rhythmic sound in the ear that occurs with the heartbeat, known as pulsatile tinnitus. Symptoms also may include trouble with vision, such as: | Vision changes. | Eye bulge. | Swelling in the eye lining. | Paralysis of a muscle in or around the eye. | Rarely, dementia may occur due to increased pressure in the blood vessels in the brain.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dural-arteriovenous-fistulas/symptoms-causes/syc-20364280

Dwarfism,"Dwarfism is short stature that results from a genetic or medical condition. Stature is the height of a person in a standing position. Dwarfism generally is defined as an adult height of 4 feet, 10 inches (147 cm) or less. The average adult height among people with dwarfism is 4 feet, 1 inch (125 cm) for women and 4 feet, 4 inches (132 cm) for men.
Many medical conditions cause dwarfism. In general, dwarfism is divided into two broad categories:
Some people prefer the term ""short stature"" or ""little people"" rather than ""dwarf"" or ""dwarfism."" It's important to be sensitive to the preference of someone who has this condition. Short stature conditions don't include familial short stature — short height that's thought of as a typical variation with typical bone development.",Symptoms — other than short stature — vary greatly across the range of dwarfism conditions.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dwarfism/symptoms-causes/syc-20371969
Dysarthria,"Dysarthria happens when the muscles used for speech are weak or are hard to control. Dysarthria often causes slurred or slow speech that can be difficult to understand.
Common causes of dysarthria include conditions that affect the nervous system or that cause facial paralysis. These conditions may cause tongue or throat muscle weakness. Certain medicines also can cause dysarthria.
Treating the underlying cause of dysarthria may improve your speech. You also may need speech therapy. For dysarthria caused by prescription medicines, changing or stopping the medicines may help.","Symptoms of dysarthria depend on the underlying cause and the type of dysarthria. | Symptoms may include: | Slurred speech. | Slow speech. | Not being able to speak louder than a whisper or speaking too loudly. | Rapid speech that is difficult to understand. | Nasal, raspy or strained voice. | Uneven speech rhythm. | Uneven speech volume. | Monotone speech. | Trouble moving your tongue or facial muscles.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dysarthria/symptoms-causes/syc-20371994
Dyshidrosis,"Dyshidrosis is a skin condition that causes small, fluid-filled blisters to form on the palms of the hands and sides of the fingers. Sometimes the bottoms of the feet are affected too.
The itchy blisters last a few weeks and often come back.
Treatment for dyshidrosis most often includes prescription steroid skin creams or ointments. Your doctor or other health care provider may suggest a different treatment, such as light therapy or medicine taken by mouth or injection. The right treatment depends on how severe your symptoms are.
Dyshidrosis is also called dyshidrotic eczema and pompholyx.","Dyshidrosis symptoms include painful, itchy and fluid-filled blisters on the sides of the fingers, the palms of the hands and the bottoms of the feet. The blisters are small — about the width of a standard pencil lead. They are grouped in clusters and can look like tapioca. | With severe disease, the small blisters can merge to form larger blisters. Skin affected by dyshidrosis can be painful and very itchy. After a few weeks, the blisters dry and flake off. | Dyshidrosis tends to come back regularly for months or years.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dyshidrosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352342
Dyslexia,"Dyslexia is a learning disorder that involves difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words (decoding). Also called a reading disability, dyslexia is a result of individual differences in areas of the brain that process language.
Dyslexia is not due to problems with intelligence, hearing or vision. Most children with dyslexia can succeed in school with tutoring or a specialized education program. Emotional support also plays an important role.
Though there's no cure for dyslexia, early assessment and intervention result in the best outcome. Sometimes dyslexia goes undiagnosed for years and isn't recognized until adulthood, but it's never too late to seek help.","Signs of dyslexia can be difficult to recognize before your child enters school, but some early clues may indicate a problem. Once your child reaches school age, your child's teacher may be the first to notice a problem.

Painful intercourse (dyspareunia),"Painful intercourse can happen for reasons that range from structural problems to psychological concerns. Many people have painful intercourse at some point in their lives.
The medical term for painful intercourse is dyspareunia (dis-puh-ROO-nee-uh). It is lasting or recurrent genital pain that occurs just before, during or after sex. Talk with your healthcare professional if you're having painful intercourse. Treatments focus on the cause and can help stop or ease this common problem.","If you have painful intercourse, you might feel: | Pain only at sexual entry, called penetration. | Pain with every penetration, including putting in a tampon. | Deep pain during thrusting. | Burning pain or aching pain. | Throbbing pain lasting hours after sex.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/painful-intercourse/symptoms-causes/syc-20375967
Indigestion,"Indigestion — also called dyspepsia or an upset stomach — is discomfort in your upper abdomen. Indigestion describes certain symptoms, such as belly pain and a feeling of fullness soon after you start eating, rather than a specific disease. Indigestion can also be a symptom of other digestive disorders.
Although indigestion is common, each person may experience indigestion in a slightly different way. Symptoms of indigestion may be felt occasionally or as often as daily.
Indigestion may often be relieved with lifestyle changes and medicines.","If you have indigestion, you may have: | Early fullness during a meal.You haven't eaten much of your meal, but you already feel full and may not be able to finish eating. | Uncomfortable fullness after a meal.The feeling of fullness lasts longer than it should. | Discomfort in the upper abdomen.You feel a mild to severe pain in the area between the bottom of your breastbone and your bellybutton. | Burning in the upper abdomen.You feel an uncomfortable heat or burning sensation between the bottom of your breastbone and your bellybutton. | Bloating in the upper abdomen.You feel an uncomfortable sensation of tightness in your upper abdomen. | Nausea.You feel as if you want to vomit. | Less frequent symptoms include vomiting and belching. | Sometimes people with indigestion also experience heartburn. Heartburn is a pain or burning feeling in the center of your chest that may radiate into your neck or back during or after eating.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/indigestion/symptoms-causes/syc-20352211
Heart arrhythmia,"A heart arrhythmia (uh-RITH-me-uh) is an irregular heartbeat. A heart arrhythmia occurs when the electrical signals that tell the heart to beat don't work properly. The heart may beat too fast or too slow. Or the pattern of the heartbeat may be inconsistent.
A heart arrhythmia may feel like a fluttering, pounding or racing heartbeat. Some heart arrhythmias are harmless. Others may cause life-threatening symptoms.
There are times when it is OK to have a fast or slow heartbeat. For example, the heart may beat faster with exercise or slow down during sleep.
Heart arrhythmia treatment may include medicines, devices such as pacemakers, or a procedure or surgery. The goals of treatment are to control or get rid of fast, slow or otherwise irregular heartbeats. A heart-healthy lifestyle can help prevent heart damage that can trigger some heart arrhythmias.","A heart arrhythmia may not cause any symptoms. The irregular heartbeat may be noticed during a health checkup for another reason. | Symptoms of an arrhythmia may include: | A fluttering, pounding or racing feeling in the chest. | A fast heartbeat. | A slow heartbeat. | Chest pain. | Shortness of breath. | Other symptoms may include: | Anxiety. | Feeling very tired. | Lightheadedness or dizziness. | Sweating. | Fainting or almost fainting.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-arrhythmia/symptoms-causes/syc-20350668
Persistent depressive disorder,"Persistent depressive disorder is a continuous, long-term form of depression. You may feel sad and empty, lose interest in daily activities and have trouble getting things done. You may also have low self-esteem, feel like a failure and feel hopeless. These feelings last for years and may interfere with your relationships, school, work and daily activities.
If you have persistent depressive disorder, you may find it hard to be upbeat even on happy occasions. You may be described as having a gloomy personality, constantly complaining or not able to have fun. Persistent depressive disorder is not as severe as major depression, but your current depressed mood may be mild, moderate or severe.
Because persistent depressive disorder is long term, coping with depression symptoms can be challenging. A combination of talk therapy and medicine can be effective in treating this condition.","Persistent depressive disorder symptoms usually come and go over a period of years. The intensity of symptoms can change over time. But symptoms usually don't disappear for more than two months at a time. Also, major depression episodes may occur before or during persistent depressive disorder. | Symptoms of persistent depressive disorder can cause major problems in your life and may include: | Sadness, emptiness or feeling down. | Loss of interest in daily activities. | Tiredness and lack of energy. | Low self-esteem, self-criticism or feeling you're not capable. | Trouble focusing clearly and trouble making decisions. | Problems getting things done well and on time. | Quickly becoming annoyed, impatient or angry. | Avoidance of social activities. | Feelings of guilt and worries over the past. | Poor appetite or overeating. | Sleep problems. | Hopelessness. | In children, symptoms of persistent depressive disorder may include depressed mood and being irritable, which means easily becoming annoyed, impatient or angry.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/persistent-depressive-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20350929
Dystonia,"Dystonia is a movement disorder that causes the muscles to contract. This can cause twisting motions or other movements that happen repeatedly and that aren't under the person's control.
When the condition affects one part of the body, it's called focal dystonia. When it affects two or more areas of the body next to each other, it's called segmental dystonia. When dystonia affects all parts of the body, it's known as general dystonia. The muscle spasms can range from mild to more serious. They may be painful, and they can affect the person's ability to complete daily tasks.
There's no cure for dystonia, but medicines and therapy can improve symptoms. Surgery is sometimes used to disable or regulate nerves or certain brain regions in people with serious dystonia.","Dystonia affects different people in different ways. Muscle spasms might: | Begin in a single area, such as your leg, neck or arm. Focal dystonia that begins after age 21 usually starts in the neck, arm or face. Although it tends to remain in the single area, it may spread to a neighboring area of the body. | Occur during a specific action, such as writing by hand. | Worsen with stress, fatigue or anxiety. | Become more noticeable over time. | Areas of the body that can be affected include: | Neck.When the neck muscles are involved, it's called cervical dystonia. Contractions cause the head to twist and turn to one side. Or the head may pull forward or backward. Cervical dystonia sometimes causes pain. | Eyelids.When muscles controlling eye blinks are involved, it's called blepharospasm. Rapid blinking or muscle spasms that cause your eyes to close make it hard to see. The muscle spasms usually aren't painful. They might increase in bright light or while reading, watching TV or interacting with people. They also might increase under stress. The eyes might feel dry, gritty or sensitive to light. | Jaw or tongue.When the muscles of the jaw and tongue are affected, it's called oromandibular dystonia. It can cause slurred speech, drooling, and trouble chewing or swallowing. This type of dystonia can be painful. It often occurs with cervical dystonia or blepharospasm. | Voice box and vocal cords.When the voice box or vocal cords are affected, it's called laryngeal dystonia. It can cause a strained or whispering voice. | Hand and forearm.Some types of dystonia occur only while doing an activity over and over, such as writing or playing a musical instrument. These are known as writer's dystonia and musician's dystonia. Symptoms usually don't happen when the arm is at rest.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dystonia/symptoms-causes/syc-20350480

E. coli,"Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria normally live in the intestines of healthy people and animals. Most types ofE. coliare harmless or cause relatively brief diarrhea. But a few strains, such asE. coliO157:H7, can cause severe stomach cramps, bloody diarrhea and vomiting.
You may be exposed toE. colifrom contaminated water or food — especially raw vegetables and undercooked ground beef. Healthy adults usually recover from infection withE. coliO157:H7 within a week. Young children and older adults have a greater risk of developing a life-threatening form of kidney failure.","Signs and symptoms ofE. coliO157:H7 infection usually begin three or four days after exposure to the bacteria. But you may become ill as soon as one day after exposure to more than a week later.

Precocious puberty,"Precocious puberty is when children's bodies begin to change into adult bodies too soon. This change is known as puberty. Most of the time, puberty occurs after age 8 in girls and after age 9 in boys. However, Black, Hispanic, and Native American children might naturally reach puberty earlier. Precocious puberty is when puberty begins too early for the child who's going through it.
In puberty, muscles and bones grow quickly. Bodies change shape and size. And the body becomes able to have children.
The cause of precocious puberty often can't be found. Rarely, certain conditions, such as infections, hormone issues, tumors, brain issues or injuries, may cause precocious puberty. Treatment for precocious puberty usually includes medicines to delay puberty.","Precocious puberty symptoms include: | Breast growth and first period in girls. | Testicle and penis growth, facial hair and deeper voice in boys. | Pubic or underarm hair. | Rapid growth. | Acne. | Adult body odor.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/precocious-puberty/symptoms-causes/syc-20351811

Eating disorders,"Eating disorders are serious health conditions that affect both your physical and mental health. These conditions include problems in how you think about food, eating, weight and shape, and in your eating behaviors. These symptoms can affect your health, your emotions and your ability to function in important areas of life.
If not treated effectively, eating disorders can become long-term problems and, in some cases, can cause death. The most common eating disorders are anorexia, bulimia and binge-eating disorder.
Most eating disorders involve focusing too much on weight, body shape and food. This can lead to dangerous eating behaviors. These behaviors can seriously affect the ability to get the nutrition your body needs. Eating disorders can harm the heart, digestive system, bones, teeth and mouth. They can lead to other diseases. They're also linked with depression, anxiety, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
With proper treatment, you can return to healthier eating habits and learn healthier ways to think about food and your body. You also may be able to reverse or reduce serious problems caused by the eating disorder.","Symptoms vary, depending on the type of eating disorder. Anorexia, bulimia and binge-eating disorder are the most common eating disorders. People with eating disorders can have all different body types and sizes.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/eating-disorders/symptoms-causes/syc-20353603
Anorexia nervosa,"Anorexia (an-o-REK-see-uh) nervosa, often simply called anorexia, is a treatable eating disorder in which people have a low body weight based on personal weight history. Although many people with anorexia look very thin, some may not look thin and others may look overweight. But they've actually lost weight or failed to gain needed weight.
People who have anorexia often have a strong fear of gaining weight and may think they're overweight, even when they're thin. To prevent weight gain or continue to lose weight, people with anorexia often limit the amount or type of food they eat. They place a high value on controlling their weight and shape and use extreme efforts that can greatly harm their lives.
Anorexia can cause changes in the brain due to very poor nutrition, also called malnutrition. This is when people don't get the nutrients that their bodies need to stay healthy. So it's not a choice to continue the risky and damaging behavior.
If left untreated, weight loss can get to a point where people with anorexia are at high risk of serious physical harm or death. Anorexia has the second-highest death rate of any mental illness, surpassed only by opioid overdoses. Most deaths related to anorexia stem from heart conditions and suicide.
Anorexia, like other eating disorders, can take over people's lives and be very hard to overcome. Because it's related to changes in the brain, anorexia behaviors are not choices, and the illness is not really about food or looking a certain way. With proven treatment, people with anorexia can return to a healthy weight, develop more-balanced eating habits, and reverse some of anorexia's serious medical and mental health complications.","The physical and behavioral symptoms of anorexia nervosa relate to how starvation affects the brain. It may be hard to notice symptoms because what is seen as a low body weight differs for each person. Some people with anorexia may not look very thin. Also, people often hide their thinness, eating habits or physical problems.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anorexia-nervosa/symptoms-causes/syc-20353591
Binge-eating disorder,"Binge-eating disorder is a serious condition. It always involves feeling like you're not able to stop eating. It also often involves eating much larger than usual amounts of food.
Almost everyone overeats on occasion, such as having seconds or thirds of a holiday meal. But regularly feeling that eating is out of control and eating an unusually large amount of food may be symptoms of binge-eating disorder.
People who have binge-eating disorder often feel embarrassed or ashamed about eating binges. People with the disorder often go through periods of trying to restrict or severely cut back on their eating as a result. But this instead may increase urges to eat and lead to a cycle of ongoing binge eating. Treatment for binge-eating disorder can help people feel more in control and balanced with their eating.","If you have binge-eating disorder, you may be overweight or obese, or you may be at a healthy weight. Most people with binge-eating disorder feel upset about their body size or shape no matter what the number on the scale is. | Symptoms of binge-eating disorder vary but can include: | Feeling that you don't have control over your eating behavior, for example, you can't stop once you start. | Often eating much larger than usual amounts of food in a specific amount of time, such as over a two-hour period. | Eating even when you're full or not hungry. | Eating very fast during eating binges. | Eating until you're uncomfortably full. | Often eating alone or in secret. | Feeling depressed, disgusted, ashamed, guilty or upset about your eating. | A person with bulimia nervosa, another eating disorder, may binge and then vomit, use laxatives or exercise excessively to get rid of extra calories. This is not the case with binge-eating disorder. If you have binge-eating disorder, you may try to diet or eat less food at mealtimes to compensate. But restricting your diet may simply lead to more binge eating. | How much eating binges affect your mood and ability to function in daily life gives an idea of how serious the condition is for you. Binge-eating disorder can vary over time. The condition may be short-lived, may go away and come back, or may continue for years if left untreated.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/binge-eating-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20353627
Bulimia nervosa,"Bulimia (boo-LEE-me-uh) nervosa, commonly called bulimia, is a serious, potentially life-threatening eating disorder. People with bulimia binge eat. This means people feel like they've lost control over their eating. They eat large amounts of food in one sitting. This often occurs in secret, and they often feel very guilty and shameful. Then they try to get rid of the food and extra calories in an unhealthy way, such as vomiting or misusing laxatives. This is called purging.
If you have bulimia, you probably focus on your weight and body shape even when you're trying to think about other things. You may judge yourself severely and harshly for what you see as flaws in your appearance and personality. Bulimia is related to how you see yourself — not just about food. It can be hard to overcome, and it can be dangerous.
It's important to remember that an eating disorder is not something you choose. Bulimia is a complex illness that affects how your brain works and how you make decisions. But effective treatment can help you feel better about yourself, eat healthier and reverse serious complications.","Bulimia symptoms may include: | Living in fear of gaining weight and trying to lose weight in unhealthy ways. | Repeatedly eating unusually large amounts of food in one sitting. | Feeling a loss of control during binge eating. You may feel like you can't stop eating or can't control what you eat. | Vomiting on purpose or exercising to extremes after binge eating so that you don't gain weight. | Using medicines that make you urinate, called water pills or diuretics, or laxatives or enemas to pass stool when they're not needed. | Fasting, limiting calories or not eating certain foods between binges. | Using dietary supplements or herbal products for weight loss. These products can be dangerous. | Being very unhappy with your body shape and weight. | Letting your body shape and weight guide how you feel about yourself and your worth. | Having extreme mood swings. | People with bulimia may use different methods to purge. The severity of bulimia depends on the number of times a week that you purge and the problems caused by doing so.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bulimia/symptoms-causes/syc-20353615
Ebstein anomaly,"Ebstein anomaly is a rare heart condition that's present at birth. That means it's a congenital heart defect.
In this condition, the valve that separates the top and bottom right heart chambers does not form correctly. This valve is called the tricuspid valve. As a result, the valve does not close as it should. Blood moves backward from the bottom to top chamber, making it harder for the heart to work.
In people with Ebstein anomaly, the heart can grow larger. The condition can lead to heart failure.
Treatment of Ebstein anomaly depends on the symptoms. Some people without symptoms only need regular health checkups. Others may need medicines and surgery.","Some babies born with Ebstein anomaly have few or no symptoms. Others have a tricuspid valve that leaks severely and causes more-noticeable symptoms. Sometimes symptoms don't occur until later in life. | Symptoms of Ebstein anomaly may include: | Blue or gray lips or fingernails. Depending on skin color, these color changes may be harder or easier to see. | Fatigue. | Feeling of a pounding or rapid heartbeat or irregular heartbeats. | Shortness of breath, especially with activity.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ebsteins-anomaly/symptoms-causes/syc-20352127

Ectropion,"Ectropion (ek-TROH-pee-on) is a condition in which your eyelid turns outward. This leaves the inner eyelid surface exposed and prone to irritation.
Ectropion is more common in older adults, and it generally affects only the lower eyelid. In severe ectropion, the entire length of the eyelid is turned out. In less severe ectropion, only one segment of the eyelid sags away from the eye.
Artificial tears and lubricating ointments can help relieve symptoms of ectropion. But usually surgery is needed to fully correct the condition.","Normally when you blink, your eyelids distribute tears evenly across your eyes, keeping the surfaces of the eyes lubricated. These tears drain into small openings on the inner part of your eyelids (puncta). | If you have ectropion, your lower lid pulls away from your eye and tears don't drain properly into the puncta. The resulting signs and symptoms can include: | Watery eyes (excessive tearing).Without proper drainage, your tears may pool and constantly flow over your eyelids. | Excessive dryness.Ectropion can cause your eyes to feel dry, gritty and sandy. | Irritation.Stagnant tears or dryness can irritate your eyes, causing a burning sensation and redness in your eyelids and the whites of your eyes. | Sensitivity to light.Stagnant tears or dry eyes can irritate the surface of the cornea, making you sensitive to light.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ectropion/symptoms-causes/syc-20351164
Atopic dermatitis (eczema),"Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is a condition that causes dry, itchy and inflamed skin. It's common in young children but can occur at any age. Atopic dermatitis is long lasting (chronic) and tends to flare sometimes. It can be irritating but it's not contagious.
People with atopic dermatitis are at risk of developing food allergies, hay fever and asthma.
Moisturizing regularly and following other skin care habits can relieve itching and prevent new outbreaks (flares). Treatment may also include medicated ointments or creams.","Atopic dermatitis (eczema) symptoms can appear anywhere on the body and vary widely from person to person. They may include: | Dry, cracked skin | Itchiness (pruritus) | Rash on swollen skin that varies in color depending on your skin color | Small, raised bumps, on brown or Black skin | Oozing and crusting | Thickened skin | Darkening of the skin around the eyes | Raw, sensitive skin from scratching | Atopic dermatitis often begins before age 5 and may continue into the teen and adult years.

Dyshidrosis,"Dyshidrosis is a skin condition that causes small, fluid-filled blisters to form on the palms of the hands and sides of the fingers. Sometimes the bottoms of the feet are affected too.
The itchy blisters last a few weeks and often come back.
Treatment for dyshidrosis most often includes prescription steroid skin creams or ointments. Your doctor or other health care provider may suggest a different treatment, such as light therapy or medicine taken by mouth or injection. The right treatment depends on how severe your symptoms are.
Dyshidrosis is also called dyshidrotic eczema and pompholyx.","Dyshidrosis symptoms include painful, itchy and fluid-filled blisters on the sides of the fingers, the palms of the hands and the bottoms of the feet. The blisters are small — about the width of a standard pencil lead. They are grouped in clusters and can look like tapioca. | With severe disease, the small blisters can merge to form larger blisters. Skin affected by dyshidrosis can be painful and very itchy.

Erectile dysfunction,"Erectile dysfunction means not being able to get and keep an erection firm enough for sexual activity. It also is called impotence.
Having erection trouble from time to time isn't always a cause for concern. But if erectile dysfunction is ongoing, it can cause stress, affect self-confidence and add to challenges with a partner. Problems getting or keeping an erection can be a sign of a health condition that needs treatment and a risk factor for heart disease.
If you're worried about erectile dysfunction, talk to your healthcare professional, even if it's awkward. Sometimes, treating an underlying condition can fix erectile dysfunction. Or you might need medicines or other direct treatments.",Having trouble getting an erection once in a while is common. Erectile dysfunction symptoms are ongoing and often get worse over time.

Edema,"Edema is swelling caused by too much fluid trapped in the body's tissues. Edema can affect any part of the body. But it's more likely to show up in the legs and feet.
Medicines and pregnancy can cause edema. It also can be the result of a disease, such as congestive heart failure, kidney disease, venous insufficiency or cirrhosis of the liver.
Wearing compression garments and reducing salt in the diet often relieves edema. When a disease causes edema, the disease needs treatment, as well.","Symptoms of edema include: | Swelling or puffiness of the tissue right under the skin, especially in legs or arms. | Stretched or shiny skin. | Skin that holds a dimple, also known as pitting, after it's been pressed for a few seconds. | Swelling of the belly, also called the abdomen, so that it's bigger than usual. | Feeling of leg heaviness.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/edema/symptoms-causes/syc-20366493

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,"Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of inherited disorders that affect your connective tissues — primarily your skin, joints and blood vessel walls. Connective tissue is a complex mixture of proteins and other substances that provide strength and elasticity to the underlying structures in your body.
People who have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome usually have overly flexible joints and stretchy, fragile skin. This can become a problem if you have a wound that requires stitches, because the skin often isn't strong enough to hold them.
A more severe form of the disorder, called vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, can cause the walls of your blood vessels, intestines or uterus to rupture. Because vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can have serious potential complications in pregnancy, you may want to talk to a genetic counselor before starting a family.","There are many different types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but the most common signs and symptoms include: | Overly flexible joints.Because the connective tissue that holds joints together is looser, your joints can move far past the normal range of motion. Joint pain and dislocations are common. | Stretchy skin.Weakened connective tissue allows your skin to stretch much more than usual. You may be able to pull a pinch of skin up away from your flesh, but it will snap right back into place when you let go. Your skin might also feel exceptionally soft and velvety. | Fragile skin.Damaged skin often doesn't heal well. For example, the stitches used to close a wound often will tear out and leave a gaping scar. These scars may look thin and crinkly. | Symptom severity can vary from person to person and depends on the specific type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that you have.

Pulmonary embolism,"A pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that blocks and stops blood flow to an artery in the lung. In most cases, the blood clot starts in a deep vein in the leg and travels to the lung. Rarely, the clot forms in a vein in another part of the body. When a blood clot forms in one or more of the deep veins in the body, it's called a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
Because one or more clots block blood flow to the lungs, pulmonary embolism can be life-threatening. However, prompt treatment greatly reduces the risk of death. Taking measures to prevent blood clots in your legs will help protect you against pulmonary embolism.","Pulmonary embolism symptoms can vary greatly, depending on how much of your lung is involved, the size of the clots, and whether you have underlying lung or heart disease. | Common symptoms include: | Shortness of breath.This symptom usually appears suddenly. Trouble catching your breath happens even when resting and gets worse with physical activity. | Chest pain.You may feel like you're having a heart attack. The pain is often sharp and felt when you breathe in deeply. The pain can stop you from being able to take a deep breath. You also may feel it when you cough, bend or lean over. | Fainting.You may pass out if your heart rate or blood pressure drops suddenly. This is called syncope. | Other symptoms that can occur with pulmonary embolism include: | A cough that may include bloody or blood-streaked mucus | Rapid or irregular heartbeat | Lightheadedness or dizziness | Excessive sweating | Fever | Leg pain or swelling, or both, usually in the back of the lower leg | Clammy or discolored skin, called cyanosis",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pulmonary-embolism/symptoms-causes/syc-20354647
Embryonal tumors,"Embryonal tumors are growths of cells that happen in the brain. The growths involve cells that are left over from fetal development, called embryonal cells.
Embryonal tumors are a type of brain cancer, also called malignant brain tumor. This means the cells that make up the tumor can grow to invade the brain and cause damage to healthy brain tissue. They also can spread through the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, called cerebrospinal fluid.
Embryonal tumors most often happen in babies and young children. But they can happen at any age.
There are several kinds of embryonal tumors. The most common is medulloblastoma. This type of embryonal tumor starts in the lower back part of the brain, called the cerebellum.
If your child is diagnosed with an embryonal tumor, seek care at a medical center that has experience caring for children with brain tumors. Medical centers with expertise in pediatric brain tumors provide access to the latest treatments and technology to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment.",Symptoms of an embryonal tumor may include: | Headaches. | Nausea. | Vomiting. | Feeling more tired than usual. | Double vision. | Difficulty with balance. | Seizures.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/embryonal-tumor/symptoms-causes/syc-20579617
Emphysema,"Emphysema is a long-term lung condition that causes shortness of breath. Over time, the condition damages the thin walls of the air sacs in the lungs called alveoli. In healthy lungs, these sacs stretch and fill with air when you breathe in. The elastic sacs help the air leave when you breathe out. But when the air sacs are damaged in emphysema, it's hard to move air out of your lungs. This doesn't leave room for fresh, oxygen-rich air to enter your lungs.
Symptoms of emphysema include trouble breathing, especially with activity, and a wheezing sound when breathing out. How severe the condition is can vary.
Smoking is the leading cause of emphysema. Treatment can help with symptoms and may slow how fast the condition gets worse. But it can't reverse the damage.","You can have emphysema for many years without noticing any symptoms. They usually begin gradually and include: | Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity. This is the main symptom of emphysema. | Wheezing, whistling or squeaking sound when you breathe out. | Coughing. | Chest tightness or heaviness. | Feeling very tired. | Weight loss and ankle swelling that may happen as the condition gets worse over time. | You may start avoiding activities that cause you to be short of breath, so the symptoms don't become a problem until they keep you from doing daily tasks. Emphysema eventually causes trouble breathing even while you're resting. | Emphysema is one of the two common types of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The other common type is chronic bronchitis. In chronic bronchitis, the lining of the tubes that carry air to your lungs, called bronchial tubes, become irritated and swollen. This inflammation limits the space for air to move in and out of the lungs and makes extra mucus that blocks the airways. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis often occur together, so the general term COPD may be used.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/emphysema/symptoms-causes/syc-20355555
Encephalitis,"Encephalitis (en-sef-uh-LIE-tis) is inflammation of the brain. It can be caused by viral or bacterial infections, or by immune cells mistakenly attacking the brain. Viruses that can lead to encephalitis can be spread by insects such as mosquitos and ticks.
When inflammation is caused by an infection in the brain, it's known as infectious encephalitis. And when it's caused by the immune system attacking the brain, it's known as autoimmune encephalitis. Sometimes there is no known cause.
Encephalitis can sometimes lead to death. Getting diagnosed and treated right away is important because it's hard to predict how encephalitis may affect each person.","Encephalitis may cause many different symptoms including confusion, personality changes, seizures or trouble with movement. Encephalitis also may cause changes in sight or hearing. | Most people with infectious encephalitis have flu-like symptoms, such as: | Headache. | Fever. | Aches in muscles or joints. | Fatigue or weakness. | Typically, these are followed by more-serious symptoms over a period of hours to days, such as: | Stiff neck. | Confusion, agitation or hallucinations. | Seizures. | Loss of feeling or being unable to move certain areas of the face or body. | Irregular movements. | Muscle weakness. | Trouble with speech or hearing. | Loss of consciousness, including coma. | In infants and young children, symptoms also might include: | Bulging of the soft spots of an infant's skull. | Nausea and vomiting. | Stiffness affecting the whole body. | Poor feeding or not waking for a feeding. | Irritability. | In autoimmune encephalitis, symptoms may develop more slowly over several weeks. Flu-like symptoms are less common but can sometimes happen weeks before more-serious symptoms start. Symptoms are different for everyone, but it's common for people to have a combination of symptoms, including: | Changes in personality. | Memory loss. | Trouble understanding what is real and what is not, known as psychosis. | Seeing or hearing things that aren't there, known as hallucinations. | Seizures. | Changes in vision. | Sleep problems. | Muscle weakness. | Loss of sensation. | Trouble walking. | Irregular movements. | Bladder and bowel symptoms.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/encephalitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20356136

End-stage renal disease,"End-stage renal disease, also called end-stage kidney disease or kidney failure, occurs when chronic kidney disease — the gradual loss of kidney function — reaches an advanced state. In end-stage renal disease, your kidneys no longer work as they should to meet your body's needs.
Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then excreted in your urine. When your kidneys lose their filtering abilities, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes can build up in your body.
With end-stage renal disease, you need dialysis or a kidney transplant to stay alive. But you can also choose to opt for conservative care to manage your symptoms — aiming for the best quality of life during your remaining time.","Early in chronic kidney disease, you might have no signs or symptoms. As chronic kidney disease progresses to end-stage renal disease, signs and symptoms might include: | Nausea | Vomiting | Loss of appetite | Fatigue and weakness | Changes in how much you urinate | Chest pain, if fluid builds up around the lining of the heart | Shortness of breath, if fluid builds up in the lungs | Swelling of feet and ankles | High blood pressure (hypertension) that's difficult to control | Headaches | Difficulty sleeping | Decreased mental sharpness | Muscle twitches and cramps | Persistent itching | Metallic taste | Signs and symptoms of kidney disease are often nonspecific, meaning they can also be caused by other illnesses. Because your kidneys can make up for lost function, signs and symptoms might not appear until irreversible damage has occurred.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/end-stage-renal-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354532

Endometrial cancer,"Endometrial cancer is a type of cancer that begins as a growth of cells in the uterus. The uterus is the hollow, pear-shaped pelvic organ where fetal development happens.
Endometrial cancer begins in the layer of cells that form the lining of the uterus, called the endometrium. Endometrial cancer is sometimes called uterine cancer. Other types of cancer can form in the uterus, including uterine sarcoma, but they are much less common than endometrial cancer.
Endometrial cancer is often found at an early stage because it causes symptoms. Often the first symptom is irregular vaginal bleeding. If endometrial cancer is found early, surgically removing the uterus often cures it.",Symptoms of endometrial cancer may include: | Vaginal bleeding after menopause. | Bleeding between periods. | Pelvic pain.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/endometrial-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352461

Endometriosis,"Endometriosis (en-doe-me-tree-O-sis) is an often-painful condition in which tissue that is similar to the inner lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus. It often affects the ovaries, fallopian tubes and the tissue lining the pelvis. Rarely, endometriosis growths may be found beyond the area where pelvic organs are located.
Endometriosis tissue acts as the lining inside the uterus would — it thickens, breaks down and bleeds with each menstrual cycle. But it grows in places where it doesn't belong, and it doesn't leave the body. When endometriosis involves the ovaries, cysts called endometriomas may form. Surrounding tissue can become irritated and form scar tissue. Bands of fibrous tissue called adhesions also may form. These can cause pelvic tissues and organs to stick to each other.
Endometriosis can cause pain, especially during menstrual periods. Fertility problems also may develop. But treatments can help you take charge of the condition and its complications.","The main symptom of endometriosis is pelvic pain. It's often linked with menstrual periods. Although many people have cramping during their periods, those with endometriosis often describe menstrual pain that's far worse than usual. The pain also may become worse over time. | Common symptoms of endometriosis include: | Painful periods.Pelvic pain and cramping may start before a menstrual period and last for days into it. You also may have lower back and stomach pain. Another name for painful periods is dysmenorrhea. | Pain with sex.Pain during or after sex is common with endometriosis. | Pain with bowel movements or urination.You're most likely to have these symptoms before or during a menstrual period. | Excessive bleeding.Sometimes, you may have heavy menstrual periods or bleeding between periods. | Infertility.For some people, endometriosis is first found during tests for infertility treatment. | Other symptoms.You may have fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, bloating or nausea. These symptoms are more common before or during menstrual periods. | The seriousness of your pain may not be a sign of the number or extent of endometriosis growths in your body. You could have a small amount of tissue with bad pain. Or you could have lots of endometriosis tissue with little or no pain. | Still, some people with endometriosis have no symptoms. Often, they find out they have the condition when they can't get pregnant or after they get surgery for another reason. | For those with symptoms, endometriosis sometimes may seem like other conditions that can cause pelvic pain. These include pelvic inflammatory disease or ovarian cysts. Or it may be confused with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which causes bouts of diarrhea, constipation and stomach cramps. IBS also can happen along with endometriosis. This makes it harder for your health care team to find the exact cause of your symptoms.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/endometriosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354656
Enlarged breasts in men (gynecomastia),"Gynecomastia (guy-nuh-koh-MAS-tee-uh) is an increase in the amount of breast gland tissue in boys or men. An imbalance of the hormones estrogen and testosterone causes it. Gynecomastia can affect one or both breasts, sometimes unevenly.
Pseudogynecomastia is an increase in fat but not gland tissue in male breasts.
Newborns, boys going through puberty and older men may develop gynecomastia due to natural changes in hormone levels. There are other causes too.
Most often, gynecomastia isn't a serious problem. But it can be tough to cope with the condition. People with gynecomastia sometimes have pain in their breasts. And they may feel embarrassed.
Gynecomastia may go away on its own. If it doesn't, medicine or surgery may help.","Gynecomastia symptoms can include: | Pain, especially in teenagers. | Swollen breast tissue. | Tender breasts. | Sensitive nipples when they rub against clothes.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gynecomastia/symptoms-causes/syc-20351793

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH),"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a health issue that becomes more common with age. It's also called an enlarged prostate. The prostate is a small gland that helps make semen. It's found just below the bladder. And it often gets bigger as you get older.
An enlarged prostate can cause symptoms that may bother you, such as blocking the flow of urine out of the bladder. It also can cause bladder, urinary tract or kidney problems.
Many treatments can helpBPH. These include medicines, surgery and other procedures. Your health care provider can help you choose. The right option depends on things such as:","Common symptoms ofBPHinclude: | Frequent or urgent need to pee, also called urination. | Peeing more often at night. | Trouble starting to pee. | Weak urine stream, or a stream that stops and starts. | Dribbling at the end of urination. | Not being able to fully empty the bladder. | Less common symptoms include: | Urinary tract infection. | Not being able to pee. | Blood in the urine. | The symptoms ofBPHtend to slowly get worse. But sometimes they stay the same or even improve over time. | The size of the prostate doesn't always determine how serious the symptoms are. Some people with slightly enlarged prostates can have major symptoms. Others who have very enlarged prostates can have minor problems.

Enlarged spleen (splenomegaly),"Your spleen is an organ that sits just below your left rib cage. Many conditions — including infections, liver disease and some cancers — can cause an enlarged spleen. An enlarged spleen is also known as splenomegaly (spleh-no-MEG-uh-lee).
An enlarged spleen usually doesn't cause symptoms. It's often discovered during a routine physical exam. A doctor usually can't feel the spleen in an adult unless it's enlarged. Imaging and blood tests can help identify the cause of an enlarged spleen.
Treatment for an enlarged spleen depends on what's causing it. Surgery to remove an enlarged spleen usually isn't needed, but sometimes it's recommended.","An enlarged spleen typically causes no signs or symptoms, but sometimes it causes: | Pain or fullness in the left upper belly that can spread to the left shoulder | A feeling of fullness without eating or after eating a small amount because the spleen is pressing on your stomach | Low red blood cells (anemia) | Frequent infections | Bleeding easily",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/enlarged-spleen/symptoms-causes/syc-20354326

Entropion,"Entropion (en-TROH-pee-on) is a condition in which your eyelid turns inward so that your eyelashes and skin rub against the eye surface. This causes irritation and discomfort.
When you have entropion, your eyelid may be turned in all the time or only when you blink hard or squeeze your eyelids shut. Entropion is more common in older adults, and it generally affects only the lower eyelid.
Artificial tears and lubricating ointments can help relieve symptoms of entropion. But usually surgery is needed to fully correct the condition. Left untreated, entropion can cause damage to the transparent covering in the front part of your eye (cornea), eye infections and vision loss.",The signs and symptoms of entropion result from the friction of your eyelashes and outer eyelid against the surface of your eye.

Eosinophilic esophagitis,"Eosinophilic esophagitis (e-o-sin-o-FILL-ik uh-sof-uh-JIE-tis) is a chronic immune system disease. With this disease, a type of white blood cell, called an eosinophil, builds up in the lining of the tube that connects your mouth to your stomach. This tube is also called the esophagus. This buildup, which is a reaction to foods, allergens or acid reflux, can inflame or injure the esophageal tissue. Damaged esophageal tissue can lead to difficulty swallowing or cause food to get stuck when you swallow.
Eosinophilic esophagitis has been identified only since the early '90s, but is now considered a major cause of digestive system illness. Research is ongoing and will likely lead to revisions in the diagnosis and treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis.","Signs and symptoms include: | Adults: | Difficulty swallowing, also called dysphagia | Food getting stuck in the esophagus after swallowing, also known as impaction | Chest pain that is often centrally located and does not respond to antacids | Backflow of undigested food, known as regurgitation | Children: | Difficulty feeding, in infants | Difficulty eating, in children | Vomiting | Abdominal pain | Difficulty swallowing, also called dysphagia | Food getting stuck in the esophagus after swallowing, also known as impaction | No response toGERDmedication | Failure to thrive, including poor growth, malnutrition and weight loss",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/eosinophilic-esophagitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20372197

Tennis elbow,"Tennis elbow, also known as lateral epicondylitis, is a condition that can result from overuse of the muscles and tendons in the elbow. Tennis elbow is often linked to repeated motions of the wrist and arm.
Despite its name, most people who get tennis elbow don't play tennis. Some people have jobs that involve repeated movements that can lead to tennis elbow. These include plumbers, painters, carpenters and butchers. However, often tennis elbow has no clear cause.
The pain of tennis elbow occurs mainly where the tough, cord-like tissues of the forearm muscles attach to a bony bump on the outside of the elbow. The tissues are known as tendons. Pain can spread into the forearm and wrist.
Rest, pain medicines and physical therapy often help relieve tennis elbow. People for whom these treatments don't help or who have symptoms that get in the way of daily living might have a procedure, such as a shot or surgery.",The pain of tennis elbow can travel from the outside of the elbow into the forearm and wrist.

Epidermoid cysts,"Epidermoid (ep-ih-DUR-moid) cysts are harmless small bumps beneath the skin. They are most common on the face, neck and trunk.
Epidermoid cysts are slow growing and often painless, so they rarely cause problems or need treatment. You might choose to have a cyst removed if it bothers you, breaks open, or is painful or infected.","Epidermoid cyst signs and symptoms include: | A small, round bump under the skin, often on the face, neck or trunk | A tiny blackhead plugging the central opening of the cyst | A thick, smelly, cheesy substance that leaks from the cyst | An inflamed or infected bump",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epidermoid-cysts/symptoms-causes/syc-20352701
Epidermolysis bullosa,"Epidermolysis bullosa (ep-ih-dur-MOL-uh-sis buhl-LOE-sah) is a rare condition that causes fragile, blistering skin. The blisters may appear in response to minor injury, even from heat, rubbing or scratching. In severe cases, the blisters may occur inside the body, such as the lining of the mouth or stomach.
Epidermolysis bullosa is inherited, and it usually shows up in infants or young children. Some people don't develop symptoms until they're teens or young adults.
Epidermolysis bullosa has no cure, but mild forms may improve with age. Treatment focuses on caring for blisters and preventing new ones.","Epidermolysis bullosa symptoms include: | Fragile skin that blisters easily, especially on the palms and feet | Nails that are thick or unformed | Blisters inside the mouth and throat | Scalp blistering and hair loss (scarring alopecia) | Skin that looks thin | Tiny pimple-like bumps (milia) | Dental problems, such as tooth decay | Difficulty swallowing | Itchy, painful skin | Usually epidermolysis bullosa blisters are noticed during infancy.

Epididymitis,"Epididymitis (ep-ih-did-uh-MY-tis) is an inflammation of the coiled tube, called the epididymis, at the back of the testicle. The epididymis stores and carries sperm. Males of any age can get epididymitis.
Epididymitis is most often caused by a bacterial infection, including sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as gonorrhea or chlamydia. Sometimes, a testicle also becomes inflamed — a condition called epididymo-orchitis.
Epididymitis is usually treated with antibiotics and measures to relieve discomfort.","Symptoms of epididymitis might include: | A swollen, discolored or warm scrotum | Testicle pain and tenderness, usually on one side, that often comes on slowly | Pain when you pass urine | An urgent or frequent need to urinate | Discharge from the penis | Pain or discomfort in the lower abdomen or pelvic area | Blood in the semen | Less commonly, fever",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epididymitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20363853
Epiglottitis,"Epiglottitis happens when the epiglottis — a small cartilage ""lid"" that covers the windpipe — swells. The swelling blocks the flow of air into the lungs. Epiglottitis can be deadly.
Many factors can cause the epiglottis to swell. These factors include infections, burns from hot liquids and injuries to the throat.
Epiglottitis can happen at any age. Once, mainly children got it. The most common cause of epiglottitis in children was infection with Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) bacteria. The bacterium also causes pneumonia, meningitis and blood infections.
RoutineHibvaccination for infants has made epiglottitis rare in children. It's now more common in adults. The condition needs quick care to prevent deadly complications.",,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epiglottitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20372227
Epilepsy,"Epilepsy — also known as a seizure disorder — is a brain condition that causes recurring seizures. There are many types of epilepsy. In some people, the cause can be identified. In others, the cause is not known.
Epilepsy is common. It's estimated that 1.2% of people in the United States have active epilepsy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Epilepsy affects people of all genders, races, ethnic backgrounds and ages.
Seizure symptoms can vary widely. Some people may lose awareness during a seizure while others don't. Some people stare blankly for a few seconds during a seizure. Others may repeatedly twitch their arms or legs, movements known as convulsions.
Having a single seizure doesn't mean you have epilepsy. Epilepsy is diagnosed if you've had at least two unprovoked seizures at least 24 hours apart. Unprovoked seizures don't have a clear cause.
Treatment with medicines or sometimes surgery can control seizures for most people with epilepsy. Some people require lifelong treatment. For others, seizures go away. Some children with epilepsy may outgrow the condition with age.","Seizure symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. Because epilepsy is caused by certain activity in the brain, seizures can affect any brain process. Seizure symptoms may include: | Temporary confusion. | A staring spell. | Stiff muscles. | Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs. | Loss of consciousness. | Psychological symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu. | Sometimes people with epilepsy may have changes in their behavior. They also may have symptoms of psychosis. | Most people with epilepsy tend to have the same type of seizure each time. Symptoms are usually similar from episode to episode.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epilepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350093
Frontal lobe seizures,"Frontal lobe seizures are a common form of epilepsy. Epilepsy is a brain disorder in which clusters of brain cells send a burst of electrical signals. This causes movements that can't be controlled, known as seizures. Frontal lobe seizures begin in the front of the brain, the area known as the frontal lobe.
The frontal lobe is large and has important functions. For this reason, frontal lobe seizures can produce symptoms that are unusual and may appear to be related to a mental illness. The seizures also can be mistaken for a sleep disorder because they often occur during sleep. Frontal lobe seizures also are known as frontal lobe epilepsy.
Changes in brain tissue, infection, injury, stroke, tumors or other conditions can cause frontal lobe seizures.
Medicines can help control the seizures. Surgery or electrical stimulation might be options if medicines don't reduce or stop the seizures.","Frontal lobe seizures often last less than 30 seconds. Sometimes recovery is immediate. | Symptoms of frontal lobe seizures might include: | Head and eye movement to one side. | Not responding to others or having trouble speaking. | Explosive screams, including profanities or laughter. | Body posturing. A common posture is extending one arm while the other flexes, as if the person is posing like a fencer. | Repetitive movements.

Esophageal cancer,"Esophageal cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the esophagus. The esophagus is a long, hollow tube that runs from the throat to the stomach. The esophagus helps move swallowed food from the back of the throat to the stomach to be digested.
Esophageal cancer usually begins in the cells that line the inside of the esophagus. Esophageal cancer can happen anywhere along the esophagus.
Esophageal cancer is more common in men. Risk factors include drinking alcohol and smoking.
Esophageal cancer treatment often involves surgery to remove the cancer. Other treatments may include chemotherapy, radiation or a combination of the two. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy also may be used.","Esophageal cancer may not cause symptoms early on. Symptoms of esophageal cancer usually happen when the disease is advanced. | Signs and symptoms of esophageal cancer include: | Difficulty swallowing. | Chest pain, pressure or burning. | Coughing or hoarseness. | Weight loss without trying. | Worsening indigestion or heartburn.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/esophageal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20356084
Esophageal spasms,"Esophageal spasms are painful contractions in the muscular tube connecting the mouth and stomach, called the esophagus. Esophageal spasms can feel like sudden, bad chest pain that lasts from a few minutes to hours. Some people may mistake it for heart pain, also called angina.
Esophageal spasms usually happen only now and then, and they might not need treatment. But sometimes the spasms happen a lot and can prevent food and liquids from traveling through the esophagus. If esophageal spasms affect the ability to eat or drink, treatments are available.","Symptoms of esophageal spasms include: | Squeezing pain in the chest. The pain is often intense and might be mistaken for heart pain or heartburn. | Difficulty swallowing solids and liquids, sometimes related to swallowing specific substances. Red wine or extremely hot or cold liquids are more common culprits. | The feeling that an object is stuck in the throat. | The return of food and liquids back up the esophagus, also called regurgitation.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/esophageal-spasms/symptoms-causes/syc-20372250
Esophageal varices,"Esophageal varices are enlarged veins in the esophagus, the tube that connects the throat and stomach. Esophageal varices most often happen in people with serious liver diseases.
Esophageal varices form when regular blood flow to the liver is blocked by a clot or scar tissue in the liver. To go around the blockages, blood flows into smaller blood vessels that aren't designed to carry large volumes of blood. The vessels can leak blood or even burst, causing life-threatening bleeding.
A few medicines and medical procedures are available to help prevent or stop bleeding from esophageal varices.","Esophageal varices usually don't cause symptoms unless they bleed. Symptoms of bleeding esophageal varices include: | Vomiting large amounts of blood. | Black, tarry or bloody stools. | Lightheadedness due to blood loss. | Loss of consciousness in severe cases. | A healthcare professional might suspect esophageal varices if someone has signs of liver disease or has been diagnosed with liver cirrhosis, including: | Yellow coloration of your skin and eyes, known as jaundice. | Easy bleeding or bruising. | Fluid buildup in your belly, called ascites (uh-SAHY-teez).",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/esophageal-varices/symptoms-causes/syc-20351538
Esophagitis,"Esophagitis is swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of the tissues that line the esophagus. The esophagus is the muscular tube that carries food and drink from the mouth to the stomach.
Esophagitis (uh-sof-uh-JIE-tis) can cause painful, difficult swallowing. It also can lead to chest pain. Various things can cause esophagitis. Some common causes include stomach acids backing up into the esophagus, infection, medicines taken by mouth and allergies.
Treatment for esophagitis depends on its exact cause and how badly the tissue that lines the esophagus is damaged. Without treatment, esophagitis can damage this lining. The esophagus may start to have trouble moving food and liquid from the mouth to the stomach. Esophagitis also can lead to other serious health issues. These include scarring or narrowing of the esophagus, unhealthy weight loss, and dehydration.","Common symptoms of esophagitis include: | Trouble swallowing. | Painful swallowing. | Swallowed food becoming stuck in the esophagus, also known as food impaction. | Burning pain in the chest called heartburn. It's common to feel this pain behind the breastbone while eating. | Stomach acid that backs up into the esophagus, also called acid reflux. | Babies and some children with esophagitis are too young to explain their discomfort or pain. Their symptoms can include: | Feeding troubles, such as getting easily upset, arching of the back and not wanting to eat. | Failure to thrive. | Chest or belly pain in older children.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/esophagitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20361224
Essential tremor,"Essential tremor is a nervous system condition, also known as a neurological condition. It causes rhythmic shaking that you can't control. Essential tremor can affect almost any part of the body, but the trembling happens most often in the hands. The trembling occurs especially when doing simple tasks, such as drinking from a glass or tying shoelaces.
Essential tremor usually is not a dangerous condition. However, it typically worsens over time and can be severe for some people. Other conditions don't cause essential tremor, but essential tremor sometimes is confused with Parkinson's disease.
Essential tremor can happen at any age but is most common in people age 40 and older.","Essential tremor symptoms: | Begin gradually. They usually are more noticeable on one side of the body. | Worsen with movement. | Usually happen in the hands first, affecting one hand or both hands. | Can include a ""yes-yes"" or ""no-no"" double nodding or shaking motion of the head. | May worsen with emotional stress, fatigue, caffeine or extreme temperatures.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/essential-tremor/symptoms-causes/syc-20350534
Esthesioneuroblastoma,"Esthesioneuroblastoma (es-thee-zee-o-noo-row-blas-TOE-muh) is a rare type of cancer that starts in the upper part of the inside of the nose, known as the nasal cavity. Esthesioneuroblastoma also is called olfactory neuroblastoma.
This cancer usually affects adults. But it can occur at any age. Esthesioneuroblastoma usually begins as a growth of cells, called a tumor, inside the nose. It might grow and go into the sinuses, eyes and brain. It also can spread to other parts of the body.
People with esthesioneuroblastoma can lose their sense of smell. They might get nosebleeds. And they might have trouble breathing through their nose as the tumor grows.
Esthesioneuroblastoma treatment usually includes surgery. Often, radiation and chemotherapy are part of the treatment as well.","Esthesioneuroblastoma symptoms include: | Loss of the sense of smell. | Frequent nosebleeds. | Difficulty breathing through the nose. | As the cancer grows, it might cause eye pain, loss of vision, ear pain and headaches.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/esthesioneuroblastoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20351075
Ewing sarcoma,"Ewing sarcoma is a type of cancer that begins as a growth of cells in the bones and the soft tissue around the bones. Ewing (Yoo-ing) sarcoma mostly happens in children and young adults, although it can happen at any age.
Ewing sarcoma most often begins in the leg bones and in the pelvis, but it can happen in any bone. Less often, it starts in the soft tissues of the chest, abdomen, arms or other locations.
Major advances in the treatment of Ewing sarcoma have improved the outlook for this cancer. Young people diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma are living longer. They sometimes face late effects from the strong treatments. Healthcare professionals often suggest long-term monitoring for side effects after treatment.","Ewing sarcoma signs and symptoms typically start in and around a bone. This cancer most often affects bones in the legs and the pelvis. | When symptoms happen in and around a bone, they might include: | A lump in the arm, leg, chest or pelvis. | Bone pain. | Break in a bone, also called a fracture. | Pain, swelling or tenderness near the affected area. | Sometimes Ewing sarcoma causes symptoms that affect the whole body.

Acromegaly,"Acromegaly is a rare condition in adults that causes some bones, organs and other tissue to grow bigger. A small gland in the brain called the pituitary gland drives these changes by making too much growth hormone. This usually happens due to a tumor of the pituitary gland. The tumor isn't cancer.
When the body has too much growth hormone, bones get bigger. In childhood, this leads to increased height as part of a condition called gigantism. In adults with acromegaly, a change in height doesn't happen. Instead, bones in the hands, feet and face become bigger.
These changes happen slowly over many years. So people with acromegaly and their loved ones may take a long time to notice the symptoms. And healthcare professionals may have a hard time finding and treating the condition early on.
Without treatment, acromegaly can lead to other serious and sometimes life-threatening health conditions called complications. But treatments such as surgery, medicine and radiation can lower the risk of complications. Treatment also can improve many acromegaly symptoms.","Acromegaly symptoms can change the way some body parts look. Changes can include: | Thick ears and lips. | A broad nose. | Enlarged hands and feet. | A jutting brow or jaw. | Gaps between teeth. | An enlarged tongue. | An expanded rib cage that may cause the chest to have a round shape. | Skin changes can include: | Acne. | Harmless skin growths called skin tags. | Coarse, oily and thickened skin. | Swelling in the tissue under the skin. | Most often, people with acromegaly don't have every possible body change. And because the changes come on slowly, they may take years to notice. But over time, rings may no longer fit fingers like they used to. Or shoe size may get bigger. Sometimes, people notice the changes only by comparing old photos with newer ones. | Other acromegaly symptoms can include: | Vision troubles, including loss of side vision. | More sweating and body odor than is typical. | Extreme tiredness. | Headaches. | Joint pain. | Deeper voice.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acromegaly/symptoms-causes/syc-20351222
Narcolepsy,"Narcolepsy is a condition that makes people very sleepy during the day and can cause them to fall asleep suddenly. Some people also have other symptoms, such as muscle weakness when they feel strong emotions.
The symptoms can have serious effects on daily life. People with narcolepsy have trouble staying awake for long periods of time. When narcolepsy causes a sudden loss of muscle tone, it is known as cataplexy (KAT-uh-plek-see). This can be triggered by a strong emotion, especially one that causes laughter.
Narcolepsy is divided into two types. Most people with type 1 narcolepsy have cataplexy. Most people with type 2 narcolepsy don't have cataplexy.
Narcolepsy is a lifelong condition and does not have a cure. However, medicines and lifestyle changes can help manage the symptoms. Support from family, friends, employers and teachers can help people cope with the condition.","The symptoms of narcolepsy may get worse during the first few years. Then they continue for life. Symptoms include: | Extreme daytime sleepiness.Daytime sleepiness is the first symptom to appear, and the sleepiness makes it hard to focus and function. People with narcolepsy feel less alert and focused during the day. They also fall asleep without warning. Sleep can happen anywhere and at any time. It may happen when they are bored or while doing a task. For example, people with narcolepsy can suddenly fall asleep while working or talking with friends. It can be especially dangerous to fall asleep while driving. Sleep may last only a few minutes or up to a half-hour. After waking, people with narcolepsy feel refreshed but get sleepy again. | Automatic behaviors.Some people with narcolepsy continue doing a task when they fall asleep briefly. For example, they may fall asleep while writing, typing or driving. They might continue to perform that task while asleep. After waking, they can't remember what they did, and they probably didn't do it well. | Sudden loss of muscle tone.This condition is called cataplexy. It can cause slurred speech or complete weakness of most muscles for up to a few minutes. It's triggered by intense emotions — often positive emotions. Laughter or excitement may cause sudden muscle weakness. But sometimes fear, surprise or anger can cause the loss of muscle tone. For example, when you laugh, your head may drop without your control. Or your knees may suddenly lose strength, causing you to fall. Some people with narcolepsy experience only one or two episodes of cataplexy a year. Others have several episodes a day. Not everyone with narcolepsy has these symptoms. | Sleep paralysis.People with narcolepsy may experience sleep paralysis. During sleep paralysis, the person can't move or speak while falling asleep or upon waking. The paralysis is usually brief — lasting a few seconds or minutes. But it can be scary. You may be aware of it happening and can recall it afterward. Not everyone with sleep paralysis has narcolepsy. | Hallucinations.Sometimes people see things that aren't there during sleep paralysis. Hallucinations also may happen in bed without sleep paralysis. These are called hypnagogic hallucinations if they happen as you fall asleep. They're called hypnopompic hallucinations if they happen upon waking. For example, the person might think they see a stranger in the bedroom who isn't there. These hallucinations may be vivid and frightening because you may not be fully asleep when you begin dreaming. | Changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.REM sleep is when most dreaming happens. Typically, people enter REM sleep 60 to 90 minutes after falling asleep. But people with narcolepsy often move more quickly to REM sleep. They tend to enter REM sleep within 15 minutes of falling asleep. REM sleep also can happen at any time of the day.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcolepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20375497
Heavy menstrual bleeding,"Some women have menstrual bleeding that is heavy or lasts for more than a few days. This condition used to be called menorrhagia. Heavy menstrual bleeding is a common concern. But most women don't have enough blood loss for it to be called heavy menstrual bleeding.
Some women have menstrual bleeding between periods, or earlier or later in their cycles than expected. This type of bleeding is called abnormal uterine bleeding or irregular menstrual bleeding.
With heavy menstrual bleeding, blood flow and cramping make it harder to do your usual activities. If you dread your period because you have heavy menstrual bleeding, talk with your doctor. There are many treatments that can help.","Symptoms of heavy menstrual bleeding may include: | Soaking through one or more sanitary pads or tampons every hour for several hours in a row. | Needing double sanitary protection to control your menstrual flow. | Getting up at night to change sanitary pads or tampons. | Bleeding for more than a week. | Passing blood clots larger than a quarter. | Limiting daily activities due to heavy menstrual flow. | Feeling tired, fatigued or short of breath as the result of blood loss.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menorrhagia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352829

Eye melanoma,"Eye melanoma is a kind of eye cancer that starts in cells within the eye that make melanin. Melanin is most often known as the pigment that gives skin its color. But the eyes have cells that make melanin too. Eye melanoma also is called ocular melanoma, intraocular melanoma and uveal melanoma.
Most eye melanomas form in parts of the eye you can't see when looking in a mirror. That makes eye melanoma hard to notice. And eye melanoma typically doesn't cause symptoms at first.
Eye melanoma can be treated. Treatment for small eye melanomas may not cause vision problems. But treatment for large eye melanomas typically leads to some vision loss.","Eye melanoma may not cause any symptoms. When they do happen, signs and symptoms of eye melanoma can include: | Flashes of light or what look like specks of dust in a person's vision. These are sometimes called floaters. | A growing dark spot in the colored part of the eye, called the iris. | A change in the shape of the pupil. The pupil is the dark circle at the center of the eye. | Poor vision or blurry vision in one eye. | Not being able to see when looking to the side. This is called loss of peripheral vision.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/eye-melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20372371

Eyestrain,"Eyestrain is a common condition that occurs when your eyes get tired from intense use, such as while driving long distances or staring at computer screens and other digital devices.
Eyestrain can be annoying. But it usually isn't serious, and it goes away once you rest your eyes or take other steps to reduce your eye discomfort. In some cases, symptoms of eyestrain can indicate an underlying eye condition that needs treatment.","Eyestrain symptoms include: | Sore, tired, burning or itching eyes | Watery or dry eyes | Blurred or double vision | Headache | Sore neck, shoulders or back | Increased sensitivity to light, called photophobia | Difficulty concentrating | Feeling that you cannot keep your eyes open",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/eyestrain/symptoms-causes/syc-20372397

Bell's palsy,"Bell's palsy is a condition that causes sudden weakness in the muscles on one side of the face. Often the weakness is short-term and improves over weeks. The weakness makes half of the face appear to droop. Smiles are one-sided, and the eye on the affected side is hard to close.
Bell's palsy also is known as acute peripheral facial palsy of unknown cause. It can occur at any age. The exact cause is not known. Experts think it's caused by swelling and irritation of the nerve that controls the muscles on one side of the face. Bell's palsy could be caused by a reaction that occurs after a viral infection.
Symptoms usually start to improve within a few weeks, with complete recovery in about six months. A small number of people continue to have some Bell's palsy symptoms for life. Rarely, Bell's palsy occurs more than once.","Symptoms of Bell's palsy come on suddenly and may include: | Mild weakness to total paralysis on one side of the face — occurring within hours to days. | Facial droop and trouble making facial expressions, such as closing an eye or smiling. | Drooling. | Pain around the jaw or pain in or behind the ear on the affected side. | Increased sensitivity to sound on the affected side. | Headache. | Loss of taste. | Changes in the amount of tears and saliva produced. | Rarely, Bell's palsy can affect the nerves on both sides of the face.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bells-palsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20370028
Factitious disorder,"Factitious disorder, previously called Munchausen syndrome, is a serious mental health condition in which people deceive others by pretending to be sick. They do this by faking symptoms, getting sick on purpose or hurting themselves. Factitious disorder also can happen when family members or caregivers falsely present others, such as children, as being ill, hurt or having a hard time functioning.
Factitious disorder symptoms can range from mild to severe. People may make up symptoms or even tamper with medical tests to convince others that they need treatment, such as high-risk surgery.
Factitious disorder isn't the same as making up medical issues for a benefit or reward, such as getting out of work or winning a lawsuit. Although people with factitious disorder know they are causing their symptoms or illnesses, they may not know why they do what they do or see themselves as having mental health issues.
Factitious disorder is a rare condition that can be hard to diagnose and treat. Help from medical and mental health professionals is critical to prevent serious injury and even death when people with factitious disorder hurt themselves.","Factitious disorder symptoms involve people trying to look ill, making themselves ill or hurting themselves. They also may fake symptoms, make symptoms seem worse than they are or pretend they can't do certain things because of their symptoms so they can deceive others. People with the condition work hard to hide their lies. It may be hard to know that their symptoms are part of a serious mental health condition. People with this condition continue with the lies, even without any benefit or reward, or when faced with evidence that doesn't support their claims. | Factitious disorder symptoms may include: | Clever and convincing medical or mental health problems. | Deep knowledge of medical terms and diseases. | Vague symptoms or symptoms that aren't consistent. | Conditions that get worse for no clear reason. | Conditions that don't respond as expected to standard treatments. | Seeking treatment from many healthcare professionals or hospitals, which may include using a fake name. | Not wanting healthcare professionals to talk to family or friends or other healthcare professionals. | Staying in the hospital a lot. | Desire for frequent testing or risky surgeries and procedures. | Many surgical scars or evidence of many procedures. | Having few visitors when in the hospital. | Arguing with healthcare professionals and staff.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/factitious-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20356028
Factor V Leiden,"Factor V Leiden (FAK-tur five LIDE-n) is a mutation of one of the clotting factors in the blood. This mutation can increase your chance of developing abnormal blood clots, most commonly in your legs or lungs.
Most people with factor V Leiden never develop abnormal clots. But in people who do, these abnormal clots can lead to long-term health problems or become life-threatening.
Both men and women can have factor V Leiden. Women who carry the factor V Leiden mutation may have an increased tendency to develop blood clots during pregnancy or when taking the hormone estrogen.
If you have factor V Leiden and have developed blood clots, anticoagulant medications can lessen your risk of developing additional blood clots and help you avoid potentially serious complications.","The factor V Leiden mutation does not itself cause any symptoms. Since factor V Leiden is a risk for developing blood clots in the leg or lungs, the first indication that you have the disorder may be the development of an abnormal blood clot. | Some clots do no damage and disappear on their own. Others can be life-threatening. Symptoms of a blood clot depend on what part of your body is affected.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/factor-v-leiden/symptoms-causes/syc-20372423
Flatfeet,"Flatfeet is a common condition, also known as flatfoot, in which the arches on the inside of the feet flatten when pressure is put on them. When people with flatfeet stand up, the feet point outward, and the entire soles of the feet fall and touch the floor.
Flatfeet can occur when the arches don't develop during childhood. It can also develop later in life after an injury or from the simple wear-and-tear stresses of age.
Flatfeet is usually painless. If you aren't having pain, no treatment is necessary. However, if flatfeet is causing you pain and limiting what you want to do, then an evaluation from a specialist may be warranted.","Most people have no symptoms associated with flatfeet. But some people with flatfeet experience foot pain, particularly in the heel or arch area. Pain may worsen with activity.

Tetralogy of Fallot,"Tetralogy of Fallot (teh-TRAL-uh-jee of fuh-LOW) is a rare heart condition that is present at birth. That means it's a congenital heart defect. A baby born with the condition has four different heart problems.
These heart problems affect the structure of the heart. The condition causes altered blood flow through the heart and to the rest of the body. Babies with tetralogy of Fallot often have blue or gray skin color due to low oxygen levels.
Tetralogy of Fallot is usually diagnosed during pregnancy or soon after a baby is born. If the heart changes and symptoms are mild, tetralogy of Fallot may not be noticed or diagnosed until adulthood.
People who are diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot need surgery to fix the heart. They will need regular health checkups for life.","Tetralogy of Fallot symptoms depend on how much blood flow is blocked from leaving the heart to go to the lungs. Symptoms may include: | Blue or gray skin color. | Shortness of breath and rapid breathing, especially during feeding or exercise. | Trouble gaining weight. | Getting tired easily during play or exercise. | Irritability. | Crying for long periods of time. | Fainting.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tetralogy-of-fallot/symptoms-causes/syc-20353477

Farsightedness,"Farsightedness (hyperopia) is a common vision condition in which you can see distant objects clearly, but objects nearby may be blurry.
The degree of your farsightedness influences your focusing ability. People with severe farsightedness may be able to clearly see only objects a great distance away, while those with mild farsightedness may be able to clearly see objects that are closer.
Farsightedness usually is present at birth and tends to run in families. You can easily correct this condition with eyeglasses or contact lenses. Another treatment option is surgery.","Farsightedness may mean: | Nearby objects may appear blurry | You need to squint to see clearly | You have eyestrain, including burning eyes, and aching in or around the eyes | You have general eye discomfort or a headache after doing close tasks, such as reading, writing, computer work or drawing, for a time",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/farsightedness/symptoms-causes/syc-20372495

Fuchs dystrophy,"Fuchs dystrophy is a condition in which fluid builds up in the clear tissue at the front of the eye, called the cornea. This causes your cornea to swell and thicken, leading to glare, blurred or cloudy vision, and eye discomfort.
Fuchs (fewks) dystrophy usually affects both eyes. It may cause your vision to get worse over time. The disease often starts in the 30s and 40s, but many people with Fuchs dystrophy don't develop symptoms until they reach their 50s or 60s.
Some medicines and self-care steps may help relieve symptoms of Fuchs dystrophy. When advanced disease causes more-serious vision problems, cornea transplant surgery is the best way to restore vision.","As Fuchs dystrophy gets worse, symptoms often affect both eyes. Symptoms may include: | Blurred or cloudy vision, sometimes described as a lack of clear vision. | Changes in vision throughout the day. Symptoms are worse in the morning when you wake up and slowly get better during the day. As the disease gets worse, blurred vision may take longer to get better or does not get better at all. | Glare, which can decrease your vision in dim and bright light. | Seeing halos around lights. | Pain or grittiness from tiny blisters on the surface of your cornea.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fuchs-dystrophy/symptoms-causes/syc-20352727
Fecal incontinence,"Fecal incontinence is accidental passing of solid or liquid stool. Fecal incontinence may happen when a person has a sudden urge to pass stool and cannot get to a toilet in time. Also, stool may leak when a person doesn't sense the need to pass stool.
Common causes of fecal incontinence include diarrhea, constipation, and muscle or nerve damage. Fecal incontinence can affect a person's ability to work, socialize or do typical daily activities. It often causes embarrassment or emotional stress.
Diagnosis and treatment are often avoided because the condition is difficult to discuss with a healthcare professional. Treatments can improve fecal incontinence and overall quality of life.
Fecal incontinence also may be called bowel incontinence or accidental bowel leakage.","The main symptom is not being able to control passing stool. This may happen during a short-term illness that causes diarrhea. For some people, fecal incontinence is an ongoing condition. | There are two types of fecal incontinence: | Urge incontinenceis the sudden urge to pass stool but not being able to control the urge. The need to pass stool may come on so suddenly that it's not possible to get to the toilet in time. | Passive incontinenceis passing stool when a person isn't aware of the need to pass stool.

Many people have sexual problems at some point. Some have them throughout their lives. Female sexual dysfunction can happen at any stage of life. It can happen only sometimes or all the time during sex.
Sexual response is complex. It involves how your body works, your feelings, things that happen in your life, your beliefs, your lifestyle and how you relate to your partner. A problem in any one of these areas can affect sexual desire, arousal or satisfaction. Treatment often involves more than one approach.","Symptoms vary depending on the type of sexual dysfunction.

Cold sore,"Cold sores, or fever blisters, are a common viral infection. They are tiny, fluid-filled blisters on and around the lips. These blisters are often grouped together in patches. After the blisters break, a scab forms that can last several days. Cold sores usually heal in 2 to 3 weeks without leaving a scar.
Cold sores spread from person to person by close contact, such as kissing. They're usually caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), and less commonly herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). Both of these viruses can affect the mouth or genitals and can be spread by oral sex. The virus can spread even if you don't see the sores.
There's no cure for cold sores, but treatment can help manage outbreaks. Prescription antiviral medicine or creams can help sores heal more quickly. And they may make future outbreaks happen less often and be shorter and less serious.","A cold sore usually passes through several stages: | Tingling and itching.Many people feel itching, burning or tingling around the lips for a day or so before a small, hard, painful spot appears and blisters form. | Blisters.Small fluid-filled blisters often form along the border of the lips. Sometimes they appear around the nose or cheeks or inside the mouth. | Oozing and crusting.The small blisters may merge and then burst. This can leave shallow open sores that ooze and crust over. | Symptoms vary, depending on whether this is your first outbreak or a recurrence. The first time you have a cold sore, symptoms may not start for up to 20 days after you were first exposed to the virus. The sores can last several days. And the blisters can take 2 to 3 weeks to heal completely. If blisters return, they'll often appear at the same spot each time and tend to be less severe than the first outbreak. | In a first-time outbreak, you also might experience: | Fever. | Painful gums. | Sore throat. | Headache. | Muscle aches. | Swollen lymph nodes. | Children under 5 years old may have cold sores inside their mouths.

Fibroadenoma,"A fibroadenoma (fy-broe-ad-uh-NO-muh) is a solid breast lump. This breast lump is not cancer. A fibroadenoma happens most often between ages 15 and 35. But it can be found at any age in anyone who has periods.
A fibroadenoma often causes no pain. It can feel firm, smooth and rubbery. It has a round shape. It might feel like a pea in the breast. Or it may feel flat like a coin. When touched, it moves easily within the breast tissue.
Fibroadenomas are common breast lumps. If you have a fibroadenoma, your health care provider may tell you to watch for changes in its size or feel. You may need a biopsy to check the lump or surgery to remove it. Many fibroadenomas need no further treatment.","A fibroadenoma is a solid breast lump that often causes no pain. It is: | Round with distinct, smooth borders | Easily moved | Firm or rubbery | A fibroadenoma often grows slowly. The average size is about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters).

Fibrocystic breasts,"Fibrocystic breasts are composed of tissue that feels lumpy or ropelike in texture. Doctors call this nodular or glandular breast tissue.
It's not at all uncommon to have fibrocystic breasts or experience fibrocystic breast changes. In fact, medical professionals have stopped using the term ""fibrocystic breast disease"" and now simply refer to ""fibrocystic breasts"" or ""fibrocystic breast changes"" because having fibrocystic breasts isn't a disease. Breast changes that fluctuate with the menstrual cycle and have a ropelike texture are considered normal.
Fibrocystic breast changes don't always cause symptoms. Some people experience breast pain, tenderness and lumpiness — especially in the upper, outer area of the breasts. Breast symptoms tend to be most bothersome just before menstruation and get better afterward. Simple self-care measures can usually relieve discomfort associated with fibrocystic breasts.",Signs and symptoms of fibrocystic breasts may include: | Breast lumps or areas of thickening that tend to blend into the surrounding breast tissue | Generalized breast pain or tenderness or discomfort that involves the upper outer part of the breast | Breast nodules or lumpy tissue change in size with the menstrual cycle | Green or dark brown nonbloody nipple discharge that tends to leak without pressure or squeezing | Breast changes that are similar in both breasts | Monthly increase in breast pain or lumpiness from midcycle (ovulation) to just before your period and then gets better once your period starts | Fibrocystic breast changes occur most often between 30 and 50 years of age.

Uterine fibroids,"Uterine fibroids are common growths of the uterus. They often appear during the years you're usually able to get pregnant and give birth. Uterine fibroids are not cancer, and they almost never turn into cancer. They aren't linked with a higher risk of other types of cancer in the uterus either. They're also called leiomyomas (lie-o-my-O-muhs) or myomas.
Fibroids vary in number and size. You can have a single fibroid or more than one. Some of these growths are too small to see with the eyes. Others can grow to the size of a grapefruit or larger. A fibroid that gets very big can distort the inside and the outside of the uterus. In extreme cases, some fibroids grow large enough to fill the pelvis or stomach area. They can make a person look pregnant.
Many people have uterine fibroids sometime during their lives. But you might not know you have them, because they often cause no symptoms. Your health care professional may just happen to find fibroids during a pelvic exam or pregnancy ultrasound.","Many people who have uterine fibroids don't have any symptoms. In those who do, symptoms can be influenced by the location, size and number of fibroids. | The most common symptoms of uterine fibroids include: | Heavy menstrual bleeding or painful periods. | Longer or more frequent periods. | Pelvic pressure or pain. | Frequent urination or trouble urinating. | Growing stomach area. | Constipation. | Pain in the stomach area or lower back, or pain during sex. | Rarely, a fibroid can cause sudden, serious pain when it outgrows its blood supply and starts to die. | Often, fibroids are grouped by their location.

Fibromuscular dysplasia,"Fibromuscular dysplasia is a condition that causes the medium-sized arteries in the body to narrow and grow larger. Narrowed arteries can reduce blood flow and affect how body organs work.
Fibromuscular dysplasia is most often seen in the arteries leading to the kidneys and brain. But it also can affect arteries in the legs, heart, belly area and, rarely, the arms. More than one artery can be involved.
Treatments are available to control symptoms and help prevent complications, such as stroke. But there is no cure for fibromuscular dysplasia.","Symptoms of fibromuscular dysplasia depend on which artery or arteries are affected. Some people don't have any symptoms. | If the arteries to the kidneys are affected, common symptoms include: | High blood pressure. | Problems with how the kidneys work. | If the arteries affected supply blood to the brain, symptoms might include: | Headache. | A pulsing feeling or ringing sound in your ears, called tinnitus. | Dizziness. | Sudden neck pain. | Stroke or transient ischemic attack.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fibromuscular-dysplasia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352144

Interstitial lung disease,"Interstitial (in-tur-STISH-ul) lung disease, also called ILD, describes a large group of conditions. Most of these conditions cause inflammation and progressive scarring of lung tissue. As part of this process, lung tissue thickens and stiffens, making it hard for the lungs to expand and fill with air.
At some point, the scarring from interstitial lung disease makes it harder to breathe and get enough oxygen into the bloodstream. Many people with ILD are short of breath with activity and may have a bothersome dry cough.
Interstitial lung disease can have many causes, including long-term exposure to hazardous materials such as asbestos. Some types of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, also can cause interstitial lung disease. But the cause isn't known sometimes. ILD can have many causes, so treatment varies.
The disease may get worse slowly or rapidly at a pace that often can't be predicted. Once lung scarring occurs, it generally isn't reversible. Treatment focuses on keeping more scarring from occurring, managing symptoms and making quality of life better. Medicines may slow the damage of interstitial lung disease, but many people never fully use their lungs again. Lung transplant is an option for some people who have ILD.",The main symptoms of interstitial lung disease are: | Shortness of breath at rest or shortness of breath that worsens with physical activity. | Dry cough.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/interstitial-lung-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353108
Pulmonary fibrosis,"Pulmonary fibrosis is a lung disease that occurs when lung tissue becomes damaged and scarred. This thickened, stiff tissue makes it harder for the lungs to work properly. Pulmonary fibrosis worsens over time. Some people can stay stable for a long time, but the condition gets worse faster in others. As it gets worse, people become more and more short of breath.
The scarring that happens in pulmonary fibrosis can be caused by many things. Often, doctors and other healthcare professionals cannot pinpoint what's causing the problem. When a cause cannot be found, the condition is called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis usually occurs in middle-aged and older adults. Sometimes pulmonary fibrosis is diagnosed in children and infants, but this is not common.
The lung damage caused by pulmonary fibrosis cannot be repaired. Medicines and therapies can sometimes help slow down the rate of fibrosis, ease symptoms and improve quality of life. For some people, a lung transplant might be an option.","Symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis may include: | Shortness of breath. | Dry cough. | Extreme tiredness. | Weight loss that's not intended. | Aching muscles and joints. | Widening and rounding of the tips of the fingers or toes, called clubbing. | How fast pulmonary fibrosis worsens over time and how severe the symptoms are can vary greatly from person to person.

Floor of the mouth cancer,"Floor of the mouth cancer is cancer that starts as a growth of cells under the tongue.
Floor of the mouth cancer most often begins in the thin, flat cells that line the inside of the mouth, called squamous cells. When cancer starts in these cells it's called squamous cell carcinoma.
Floor of the mouth cancer causes changes in the look and feel of the tissue under the tongue. These changes may include a lump or a sore that doesn't heal.
Floor of the mouth cancer treatments include surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.",Symptoms of floor of the mouth cancer can include: | Mouth pain. | Sores in the mouth that won't heal. | Trouble moving the tongue. | Loose teeth. | Pain with swallowing. | Weight loss. | Ear pain. | Swelling in the neck that may hurt. | White patches in the mouth that won't go away.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/floor-mouth-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20354179

Influenza (flu),"Flu, also called influenza, is an infection of the nose, throat and lungs, which are part of the respiratory system. The flu is caused by a virus. Influenza viruses are different from the ""stomach flu"" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.
Most people with the flu get better on their own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. To help protect against seasonal flu, you can get an annual flu shot. Although the vaccine isn't 100% effective, it lowers the chances of having severe complications from the flu. This is especially true for people who are at high risk of flu complications.
Aside from the vaccine, you can take other steps to help prevent infection with the flu. You can clean and disinfect surfaces, wash hands, and keep the air around you moving.","The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. In North America, flu season usually runs between October and May. | Symptoms of the flu such as a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose are common. You may also get these symptoms with other illness such as a cold. But colds tend to start slowly, and the flu tends to come on quickly, within two or three days after you come in contact with the virus. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu. | Other common flu symptoms include: | Fever. | Cough. | Headache. | Muscle aches. | Feeling very tired. | Sweating and chills. | In children, these symptoms may show up more generally as being fussy or irritable. Children also are more likely than adults to have ear pain, feel sick to the stomach, vomit or have diarrhea with the flu. | In some cases, people have eye pain, watery eyes or find that light hurts their eyes.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719
Bird flu (avian influenza),"Bird flu, also called avian influenza, is caused by influenza type A virus infections in bird species. Depending on the strain, bird flu may cause the bird to have no symptoms, mild illness, serious illness or lead to the death of the bird.
Bird flu rarely infects humans. But health officials worry because influenza A viruses that infect birds can change, called mutate, to infect humans and spread from person to person more often. Because a new strain of bird flu would be a new virus to humans, a mutated strain like that could spread quickly around the world.
People most often catch a bird flu virus from close, long-term contact with live, domesticated poultry typically on farms or in backyard coops. People also may catch bird flu through contact with wild birds or another type of animal. Bird flu rarely has spread from person to person.
In humans, flu is a viral infection of the nose, throat and lungs, which are part of the respiratory system. Symptoms of bird flu in humans are similar to flu symptoms and may be mild to serious.","Bird flu symptoms can be mild to serious in a person. Symptoms typically show up within seven days of contact with the virus but can take as long as two weeks. A person can get infected from direct contact with an infected animal, or the bedding or stool of the animal. | Flu viruses have similar symptoms. So you need to be tested to check if you have a bird flu infection. | Common bird flu symptoms include: | Fever. | Problems breathing. | Pink eye, also called conjunctivitis. | Upset stomach and vomiting. | Loose stool, called diarrhea. | Bird flu may cause breathing problems more often than other kinds of flu. And during bird flu pandemics, the risk that a person with flu will need a machine to help them breathe is higher.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bird-flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20568390
H1N1 flu (swine flu),"The H1N1 flu, sometimes called swine flu, is a type of influenza A virus.
During the 2009-10 flu season, a new H1N1 virus began causing illness in humans. It was often called swine flu and was a new combination of influenza viruses that infect pigs, birds and humans.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the H1N1 flu to be a pandemic in 2009. That year the virus caused an estimated 284,400 deaths worldwide. In August 2010,WHOdeclared the pandemic over. But the H1N1 flu strain from the pandemic became one of the strains that cause seasonal flu.
Most people with the flu get better on their own.
But flu and its complications can be deadly, especially for people at high risk. The seasonal flu vaccine can now help protect against the H1N1 flu and other seasonal flu viruses.","The symptoms of flu caused by H1N1, commonly called the swine flu, are similar to those of other flu viruses. | Symptoms usually start quickly and can include: | Fever, but not always. | Aching muscles. | Chills and sweats. | Cough. | Sore throat. | Runny or stuffy nose. | Watery, red eyes. | Eye pain. | Body aches. | Headache. | Tiredness and weakness. | Diarrhea. | Feeling sick to the stomach, vomiting, but this is more common in children than adults. | Flu symptoms develop about 1 to 4 days after you're exposed to the virus.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/swine-flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20378103

Food allergy,"Food allergy is an immune system reaction that happens soon after eating a certain food. Even a tiny amount of the allergy-causing food can trigger symptoms such as hives, swollen airways and digestive problems. In some people, a food allergy can cause severe symptoms or even a life-threatening reaction known as anaphylaxis.
Food allergy affects an estimated 8% of children under age 5 and up to 4% of adults. While there's no cure, some children outgrow their food allergies as they get older.
It's easy to confuse a food allergy with a much more common reaction known as food intolerance. While bothersome, food intolerance is a less serious condition that does not involve the immune system.","For some people, an allergic reaction to a particular food may be uncomfortable but not severe. For other people, a food allergy reaction can be frightening and even life-threatening. Food allergy symptoms usually develop within a few minutes to two hours after eating the offending food. Rarely, symptoms may be delayed for several hours. | The most common food allergy symptoms include: | Tingling or itching in the mouth. | Hives, itching or eczema. | Swelling of the lips, face, tongue, and throat or other parts of the body. | Belly pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting. | Wheezing, nasal congestion or trouble breathing. | Dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/food-allergy/symptoms-causes/syc-20355095

Food poisoning,"Food poisoning, a type of foodborne illness, is a sickness people get from something they ate or drank. The causes are germs or other harmful things in the food or beverage.
Symptoms of food poisoning often include upset stomach, diarrhea and vomiting. Symptoms usually start within hours or several days of eating the food. Most people have mild illness and get better without treatment.
Sometimes food poisoning causes severe illness or complications.",Symptoms vary depending on what is causing the illness. They may begin within a few hours or a few weeks depending on the cause. | Common symptoms are: | Upset stomach. | Vomiting. | Diarrhea. | Diarrhea with bloody stools. | Stomach pain and cramps. | Fever. | Headache. | Less often food poisoning affects the nervous system and can cause severe disease. Symptoms may include: | Blurred or double vision. | Headache. | Loss of movement in limbs. | Problems with swallowing. | Tingling or numbness of skin. | Weakness. | Changes in sound of the voice.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/food-poisoning/symptoms-causes/syc-20356230
Foot drop,"Foot drop, sometimes called drop foot, is a general term for difficulty lifting the front part of the foot. If you have foot drop, the front of your foot might drag on the ground when you walk.
Foot drop isn't a disease. Rather, it is a sign of an underlying neurological, muscular or anatomical problem.
Sometimes foot drop is temporary, but it can be permanent. If you have foot drop, you might need to wear a brace on your ankle and foot to support the foot and hold it in position.","Foot drop makes it difficult to lift the front part of the foot, so it might drag on the floor when you walk. To help the foot clear the floor, a person with foot drop may raise the thigh more than usual when walking, as though climbing stairs. This unusual kind of walking, called steppage gait, might cause the foot to slap down onto the floor with each step. In some cases, the skin on the top of the foot and toes feels numb. | Depending on the cause, foot drop can affect one or both feet.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/foot-drop/symptoms-causes/syc-20372628
Broken foot,"A broken foot, also called a fractured foot, is an injury to one or more bones in the foot. A bone might break from a sports injury, a car crash, a heavy object dropped on the foot, or a misstep or fall.
Fractures can range from tiny cracks in the bones to breaks in more than one bone and breaks that come through the skin.
Treatment for a broken foot bone depends on where the bone breaks and how bad the break is. A badly broken foot bone may need surgery to put plates, rods or screws into the broken bone pieces to hold them in place while they heal.","A broken foot bone might cause some of these symptoms: | Instant throbbing pain. | Pain that gets worse with activity and gets better with rest. | Swelling. | Bruising. | Tenderness. | Change in the typical shape of the foot, called deformity. | Trouble or pain with walking or putting weight on the foot. | Bone sticking through the skin, called an open fracture.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-foot/symptoms-causes/syc-20355492

Broken arm,"A broken arm involves one or more of the three bones in your arm — the ulna, radius and humerus. One of the most common causes of a broken arm is falling onto an outstretched hand. If you think you or your child has broken an arm, seek prompt medical attention. It's important to treat a fracture as soon as possible for proper healing.
Treatment depends on the site and severity of the injury. A simple break might be treated with a sling, ice and rest. However, the bone may require realignment (reduction) in the emergency room.
A more complicated break might require surgery to realign the broken bone and to implant wires, plates, nails or screws to keep the bone in place during healing.","A snap or cracking sound might be your first indication you've broken an arm. Signs and symptoms include: | Severe pain, which might increase with movement | Swelling | Bruising | Deformity, such as a bent arm or wrist | Inability to turn your arm from palm up to palm down or vice versa",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-arm/symptoms-causes/syc-20353260
Growth plate fractures,"A growth plate fracture affects the layer of growing tissue near the ends of a child's bones. Growth plates are the softest and weakest sections of the skeleton — sometimes even weaker than surrounding ligaments and tendons. An injury that might cause a joint sprain for an adult can cause a growth plate fracture in a child.
Growth plate fractures often need immediate treatment because they can affect how the bone will grow. An improperly treated growth plate fracture could result in a fractured bone ending up more crooked or shorter than its opposite limb. With proper treatment, most growth plate fractures heal without complications.","Most growth plate fractures occur in bones of the fingers, forearm and lower leg. Signs and symptoms of a growth plate fracture may include: | Pain and tenderness, particularly in response to pressure on the growth plate | Inability to move the affected area or to put weight or pressure on the limb | Warmth and swelling at the end of a bone, near a joint | If you suspect a fracture, take your child to be examined by a doctor. Also have your child evaluated if you notice a visible deformity in your child's arms or legs, or if your child is having trouble playing sports because of persistent pain.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/growth-plate-fractures/symptoms-causes/syc-20351979
Hip fracture,,,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hip-fracture/symptoms-causes/syc-20373468
Broken leg,"A broken leg (leg fracture) is a break or crack in one of the bones in your leg. Common causes include falls, motor vehicle accidents and sports injuries.
Treatment of a broken leg depends on the location and severity of the injury. A severely broken leg may require metal pins and plates to hold the fragments together. Less severe breaks may be treated with a cast or splint. In all cases, prompt diagnosis and treatment are critical to complete healing.","The thighbone (femur) is the strongest bone in the body. It is usually obvious when the thighbone is broken because it takes so much force to break. But a break in the shinbone (tibia) or in the bone that runs alongside the shinbone (fibula) may be less obvious. | Signs and symptoms of a broken leg may include: | Severe pain, which may worsen with movement | Swelling | Tenderness | Bruising | Obvious deformity or shortening of the affected leg | Inability to walk | Toddlers or young children who break a leg may start limping or simply stop walking, even if they can't explain why.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-leg/symptoms-causes/syc-20370412

Broken ribs,"A broken rib is a common injury that occurs when one of the bones in the rib cage breaks or cracks. The most common causes are hard impacts from falls, car accidents or contact sports.
Many broken ribs are simply cracked. Cracked ribs are painful. But they don't cause the problems that ribs that have broken into pieces can. The sharp edge of a broken bone can harm major blood vessels or lungs and other organs.
Usually, broken ribs heal on their own in about six weeks. Pain control is important for being able to breathe deeply and avoid lung issues, such as pneumonia.",The following can cause pain with a broken rib or make pain worse: | A deep breath. | Pressure on the injured area. | A bend or a twist of the body.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-ribs/symptoms-causes/syc-20350763
Frontal lobe seizures,"Frontal lobe seizures are a common form of epilepsy. Epilepsy is a brain disorder in which clusters of brain cells send a burst of electrical signals. This causes movements that can't be controlled, known as seizures. Frontal lobe seizures begin in the front of the brain, the area known as the frontal lobe.
The frontal lobe is large and has important functions. For this reason, frontal lobe seizures can produce symptoms that are unusual and may appear to be related to a mental illness. The seizures also can be mistaken for a sleep disorder because they often occur during sleep. Frontal lobe seizures also are known as frontal lobe epilepsy.
Changes in brain tissue, infection, injury, stroke, tumors or other conditions can cause frontal lobe seizures.
Medicines can help control the seizures. Surgery or electrical stimulation might be options if medicines don't reduce or stop the seizures.","Frontal lobe seizures often last less than 30 seconds. Sometimes recovery is immediate. | Symptoms of frontal lobe seizures might include: | Head and eye movement to one side. | Not responding to others or having trouble speaking. | Explosive screams, including profanities or laughter. | Body posturing. A common posture is extending one arm while the other flexes, as if the person is posing like a fencer. | Repetitive movements. These may include rocking, bicycle pedaling or pelvic thrusting.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/frontal-lobe-seizures/symptoms-causes/syc-20353958
Frontotemporal dementia,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is an umbrella term for a group of brain diseases that mainly affect the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. These areas of the brain are associated with personality, behavior and language.
In frontotemporal dementia, parts of these lobes shrink, known as atrophy. Symptoms depend on which part of the brain is affected. Some people with frontotemporal dementia have changes in their personalities. They become socially inappropriate and may be impulsive or emotionally indifferent. Others lose the ability to properly use language.
Frontotemporal dementia can be misdiagnosed as a mental health condition or as Alzheimer's disease. ButFTDtends to occur at a younger age than does Alzheimer's disease. It often begins between the ages of 40 and 65, although it can occur later in life as well.FTDis the cause of dementia about 10% to 20% of the time.","Symptoms of frontotemporal dementia differ from one person to the next. Symptoms get worse over time, usually over years. | People with frontotemporal dementia tend to have clusters of symptom types that occur together. They also may have more than one cluster of symptom types.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/frontotemporal-dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354737
Frostbite,"Frostbite is an injury caused by freezing of the skin and underlying tissues. The early stage of frostbite is called frostnip. It causes a cold feeling followed by numbness. As frostbite gets worse, the affected skin may change color and become hard or waxy-looking.
Exposed skin is at risk of frostbite in conditions that are freezing cold and windy or wet. Frostbite also can occur on skin covered by gloves or other clothing.
Mild frostbite gets better with rewarming. Seek medical attention for anything more serious than mild frostbite because the condition can cause permanent damage to skin, muscle, bone and other tissue.","Symptoms of frostbite include: | Numbness. | Tingling. | Patches of skin in shades of red, white, blue, gray, purple or brown. The color of affected skin depends on how serious the frostbite is and the usual skin color. | Cold, hard, waxy-looking skin. | Clumsiness due to joint stiffness. | Pain. | Blistering after rewarming. | Frostbite is most common on the fingers, toes, ears, cheeks, penis, chin and tip of the nose. Because of numbness, you may not notice you have frostbite until someone points it out. Changes in the color of the affected area might be difficult to see on brown and Black skin. | Frostbite occurs in several stages: | Frostnip.Frostnip is the early stage of frostbite. Symptoms are pain, tingling and numbness. Frostnip doesn't cause permanent damage to the skin. | Mild to moderate frostbite.Frostbite causes slight changes in skin color. The skin may begin to feel warm. This is a sign of serious skin involvement. If you treat frostbite with rewarming at this stage, the surface of the skin may look patchy. The affected area may sting, burn and swell. A fluid-filled blister may form 12 to 36 hours after rewarming. This stage also is called superficial frostbite. | Deep frostbite.As frostbite progresses, it affects all layers of the skin and the tissues below. The affected skin turns white or blue-gray. Large blood blisters may appear 24 to 48 hours after rewarming. Weeks after the injury, tissue may turn black and hard as it dies.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/frostbite/symptoms-causes/syc-20372656
Frozen shoulder,"Frozen shoulder, also called adhesive capsulitis, involves stiffness and pain in the shoulder joint. Signs and symptoms typically begin slowly, then get worse. Over time, symptoms get better, usually within 1 to 3 years.
Having to keep a shoulder still for a long period increases the risk of developing frozen shoulder. This might happen after having surgery or breaking an arm.
Treatment for frozen shoulder involves range-of-motion exercises. Sometimes treatment involves corticosteroids and numbing medications injected into the joint. Rarely, arthroscopic surgery is needed to loosen the joint capsule so that it can move more freely.
It's unusual for frozen shoulder to recur in the same shoulder. But some people can develop it in the other shoulder, usually within five years.","Frozen shoulder typically develops slowly in three stages. | Freezing stage.Any movement of the shoulder causes pain, and the shoulder's ability to move becomes limited. This stage lasts from 2 to 9 months. | Frozen stage.Pain might lessen during this stage. However, the shoulder becomes stiffer. Using it becomes more difficult. This stage lasts from 4 to 12 months. | Thawing stage.The shoulder's ability to move begins to improve.

Functional dyspepsia,"Functional dyspepsia is a term used to describe a lingering upset stomach that has no obvious cause. Functional dyspepsia (dis-PEP-see-uh) also is called nonulcer dyspepsia.
Functional dyspepsia is common. It is a constant condition, but symptoms don't happen all the time. Symptoms are like those of an ulcer. They include pain or discomfort in the upper belly, bloating, belching and nausea.","Symptoms of functional dyspepsia may include: | Pain or burning in the stomach, bloating, excessive belching or nausea after eating. | An early feeling of fullness when eating. The feeling of fullness also is called satiety. | Stomach pain that happens unrelated to meals or goes away when eating.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/functional-dyspepsia/symptoms-causes/syc-20375709
Nail fungus,"Nail fungus is a common infection of the nail. It begins as a white or yellow-brown spot under the tip of your fingernail or toenail. As the fungal infection goes deeper, the nail may discolor, thicken and crumble at the edge. Nail fungus can affect several nails.
If your condition is mild and not bothering you, you may not need treatment. If your nail fungus is painful and has caused thickened nails, self-care steps and medications may help. But even if treatment is successful, nail fungus often comes back.
Nail fungus is also called onychomycosis (on-ih-koh-my-KOH-sis). When fungus infects the areas between your toes and the skin of your feet, it's called athlete's foot (tinea pedis).","Symptoms of nail fungus include a nail or nails that are: | Thickened | Discolored | Brittle, crumbly or ragged | Misshapen | Separated from the nail bed | Smelly | Nail fungus can affect fingernails, but it's more common in toenails.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nail-fungus/symptoms-causes/syc-20353294
Pectus excavatum,"Pectus excavatum is a condition in which the breastbone is sunken into the chest. The sunken breastbone often can be seen shortly after birth. If the breastbone sinks a lot over time, the center of the chest may look like it's been scooped out. This change leaves a deep dent or dip. But many people with the condition just have a slight dip in the breastbone.
This condition also is known as funnel chest. But it can affect much more than the look of the chest. It also can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, and a fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart. The symptoms tend to become worse during the teenage growth spurt.
The exact cause of pectus excavatum isn't clear. When the condition is serious, it can affect how well the heart and lungs work over time. But even mild pectus excavatum that causes a slight dip in the breastbone can make children feel self-conscious about their bodies.
Surgery to repair pectus excavatum can improve symptoms and the appearance of the chest. But surgery isn't right for everyone with the condition. Other treatment choices may include physical therapy and medical devices.","For many people with pectus excavatum, the only symptom is a slight dip in their chests. In some children, the dip becomes deeper during early puberty. It can keep getting deeper into adulthood. | In people with pectus excavatum, the breastbone may compress the lungs and heart. Symptoms can include: | A fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart. | Chest pain. | Loss of endurance that becomes worse over time. | Shortness of breath or extreme tiredness during physical activity. | A high-pitched whistling sound made while breathing that's triggered by exercise. | Fainting or dizziness. | Frequent infections of the upper airway. | Stress and concern about how the chest looks.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pectus-excavatum/symptoms-causes/syc-20355483
Generalized anxiety disorder,"It's normal to feel anxious from time to time, especially if your life is stressful. However, excessive, ongoing anxiety and worry that are difficult to control and interfere with day-to-day activities may be a sign of generalized anxiety disorder.
It's possible to develop generalized anxiety disorder as a child or an adult. Generalized anxiety disorder has symptoms that are similar to panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and other types of anxiety, but they're all different conditions.
Living with generalized anxiety disorder can be a long-term challenge. In many cases, it occurs along with other anxiety or mood disorders. In most cases, generalized anxiety disorder improves with psychotherapy or medications. Making lifestyle changes, learning coping skills and using relaxation techniques also can help.","Generalized anxiety disorder symptoms can vary. They may include: | Persistent worrying or anxiety about a number of areas that are out of proportion to the impact of the events | Overthinking plans and solutions to all possible worst-case outcomes | Perceiving situations and events as threatening, even when they aren't | Difficulty handling uncertainty | Indecisiveness and fear of making the wrong decision | Inability to set aside or let go of a worry | Inability to relax, feeling restless, and feeling keyed up or on edge | Difficulty concentrating, or the feeling that your mind ""goes blank"" | Physical signs and symptoms may include: | Fatigue | Trouble sleeping | Muscle tension or muscle aches | Trembling, feeling twitchy | Nervousness or being easily startled | Sweating | Nausea, diarrhea or irritable bowel syndrome | Irritability | There may be times when your worries don't completely consume you, but you still feel anxious even when there's no apparent reason. For example, you may feel intense worry about your safety or that of your loved ones, or you may have a general sense that something bad is about to happen. | Your anxiety, worry or physical symptoms cause you significant distress in social, work or other areas of your life.

Galactorrhea,"Galactorrhea (guh-lack-toe-REE-uh) is a milky nipple discharge not linked to the making of milk for breastfeeding. Galactorrhea isn't a disease. But it can be a sign of an underlying condition.
Galactorrhea mostly happens to people assigned female at birth. It can happen even to those who haven't had children or who have gone through menopause. But galactorrhea also can happen to people assigned male at birth and even to infants.
Too much breast handling, medicine side effects or conditions of the pituitary gland may add to galactorrhea. Often, higher levels of the hormone involved in making breast milk, called prolactin, cause galactorrhea.
Sometimes, the cause of galactorrhea can't be found. The condition may clear up on its own.",Symptoms linked to galactorrhea include: | Milky nipple discharge that's constant or comes and goes. | Nipple discharge from more than one milk duct. | Nipple discharge that leaks on its own or when the breast is touched. | Nipple discharge from one or both breasts. | Irregular or no menstrual periods. | Headaches or trouble with vision.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/galactorrhea/symptoms-causes/syc-20350431
Gallbladder cancer,"Gallbladder cancer is a growth of cells that begins in the gallbladder.
The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ on the right side of the belly, just beneath the liver. The gallbladder stores a fluid called bile that the liver makes to digest food.
Gallbladder cancer is not common. The chance for a cure is good when gallbladder cancer is found when it's small. But most gallbladder cancers are found when they've grown beyond the gallbladder. Then the chance to survive, called prognosis, often is poor.
Gallbladder cancer may not be found until it's advanced because it may cause no symptoms. When they happen, the symptoms may be like those of common conditions. Also, the gallbladder is hidden inside the body. This makes it easier for gallbladder cancer to grow without being found.","Gallbladder cancer may have no symptoms. When there are signs and symptoms, they may include: | Belly pain, mostly in the upper right part of the belly. | Belly bloating. | A mass you can feel through the skin. | Losing weight without trying. | Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, called jaundice. Yellowing of the skin might be harder to see on Black or brown skin.

The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ on the right side of the belly under the liver. The gallbladder holds fluid that digests food. This fluid is called bile. The gallbladder releases bile into the small intestine.
Most often, gallstones that block the tube leading out of the gallbladder cause cholecystitis. This results in a bile buildup that can cause inflammation. Other causes of cholecystitis include bile duct changes, tumors, serious illness and certain infections.
If not treated, cholecystitis can lead to serious complications, such as gallbladder rupture. These can be life-threatening. Treatment for cholecystitis often involves surgery to remove the gallbladder.",Symptoms of cholecystitis may include: | Severe pain in the upper right or center belly area. | Pain that spreads to the right shoulder or back. | Tenderness over the belly area when it's touched. | Nausea. | Vomiting. | Fever. | Cholecystitis symptoms often come on after a meal. A large or fatty meal is most likely to cause symptoms.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cholecystitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20364867

Ganglion cyst,"Ganglion cysts are lumps that most often appear along the tendons or joints of wrists or hands. They also can occur in ankles and feet. Ganglion cysts are typically round or oval and are filled with a jellylike fluid. They are not cancer.
Small ganglion cysts can be pea-sized. They can change size. Ganglion cysts can be painful if they press on a nearby nerve. Sometimes they affect joint movement.
For a ganglion cyst that causes problems, having a health care provider drain the cyst with a needle might be an option. So might removing the cyst surgically. But if there are no symptoms, no treatment is necessary. Often, the cysts grow and shrink. Some go away on their own.","These are common features of ganglion cysts: | Location.Ganglion cysts most often develop along the tendons or joints of wrists or hands. The next most common locations are the ankles and feet. These cysts grow near other joints too. | Shape and size.Ganglion cysts are round or oval. Some are too small to feel. The size of a cyst can change, often getting larger over time with joint movement. | Pain.Ganglion cysts usually are painless.

Stomach cancer,"Stomach cancer, which is also called gastric cancer, is a growth of cells that starts in the stomach. The stomach is in the upper middle part of the belly, just below the ribs. The stomach helps to break down and digest food.
Stomach cancer can happen in any part of the stomach. In most of the world, stomach cancers happen in the main part of the stomach. This part is called the stomach body.
In the United States, stomach cancer is more likely to start by the gastroesophageal junction. This is the part where the long tube that carries food you swallow meets the stomach. The tube that carries food to the stomach is called the esophagus.
Where the cancer starts in the stomach is one factor health care providers think about when making a treatment plan. Other factors might include the cancer's stage and the type of cells involved. Treatment often includes surgery to remove the stomach cancer. Other treatments may be used before and after surgery.
Stomach cancer treatment is most likely to be successful if the cancer is only in the stomach. The prognosis for people with small stomach cancers is quite good. Many can expect to be cured. Most stomach cancers are found when the disease is advanced and a cure is less likely. Stomach cancer that grows through the stomach wall or spreads to other parts of the body is harder to cure.","Signs and symptoms of stomach cancer may include: | Trouble swallowing | Belly pain | Feeling bloated after eating | Feeling full after eating small amounts of food | Not feeling hungry when you would expect to be hungry | Heartburn | Indigestion | Nausea | Vomiting | Losing weight without trying | Feeling very tired | Stools that look black | Stomach cancer doesn't always cause symptoms in its early stages. When they happen, symptoms might include indigestion and pain in the upper part of the belly. Symptoms might not happen until the cancer is advanced. Later stages of stomach cancer might cause symptoms such as feeling very tired, losing weight without trying, vomiting blood and having black stools. | Stomach cancer that spreads to other parts of the body is called metastatic stomach cancer. It causes symptoms specific to where it spreads. For example, when cancer spreads to the lymph nodes it might cause lumps you can feel through the skin. Cancer that spreads to the liver might cause yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes. If cancer spreads within the belly, it might cause fluid to fill the belly. The belly might look swollen.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stomach-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352438
Gastroparesis,"Gastroparesis is a condition in which the muscles in the stomach don't move food as they should for it to be digested.
Most often, muscles contract to send food through the digestive tract. But with gastroparesis, the stomach's movement, called motility, slows or doesn't work at all. This keeps the stomach from emptying well.
Often, the cause of gastroparesis is not known. Sometimes it's linked to diabetes. And some people get gastroparesis after surgery or after a viral illness.
Certain medicines, such as opioid pain relievers, some antidepressants, and medicines for high blood pressure, weight loss and allergies can slow stomach emptying. The symptoms can be like those of gastroparesis. For people who already have gastroparesis, these medicines may make the condition worse.
Gastroparesis affects digestion. It can cause nausea, vomiting and belly pain. It also can cause problems with blood sugar levels and nutrition. There's no cure for gastroparesis. But medicines and changes to diet can give some relief.","Symptoms of gastroparesis include: | Vomiting. | Nausea. | Belly bloating. | Belly pain. | Feeling full after eating just a few bites and long after eating a meal. | Vomiting undigested food eaten a few hours earlier. | Acid reflux. | Changes in blood sugar levels. | Not wanting to eat. | Weight loss and not getting enough nutrients, called malnutrition. | Many people with gastroparesis don't notice any symptoms.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gastroparesis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355787

Gastritis,"Gastritis is a general term for a group of conditions with one thing in common: Inflammation of the lining of the stomach. The inflammation of gastritis is most often the result of infection with the same bacterium that causes most stomach ulcers or the regular use of certain pain relievers. Drinking too much alcohol also can contribute to gastritis.
Gastritis may occur suddenly (acute gastritis) or appear slowly over time (chronic gastritis). In some cases, gastritis can lead to ulcers and an increased risk of stomach cancer. For most people, however, gastritis isn't serious and improves quickly with treatment.","Gastritis doesn't always cause symptoms. When it does, the symptoms of gastritis may include: | Gnawing or burning ache or pain, called indigestion, in your upper belly. This feeling may become either worse or better after eating. | Nausea. | Vomiting. | A feeling of fullness in your upper abdomen after eating.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gastritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355807

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD),"Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a condition in which stomach acid repeatedly flows back up into the tube connecting the mouth and stomach, called the esophagus. It's often called GERD for short. This backwash is known as acid reflux, and it can irritate the lining of the esophagus.
Many people experience acid reflux now and then. However, when acid reflux happens repeatedly over time, it can cause GERD.
Most people can manage the discomfort of GERD with lifestyle changes and medicines. And though it's uncommon, some may need surgery to help with symptoms.","Common symptoms of GERD include: | A burning sensation in the chest, often called heartburn. Heartburn usually happens after eating and might be worse at night or while lying down. | Backwash of food or sour liquid in the throat. | Upper belly or chest pain. | Trouble swallowing, called dysphagia. | Sensation of a lump in the throat. | If you have nighttime acid reflux, you also might experience: | An ongoing cough. | Inflammation of the vocal cords, known as laryngitis. | New or worsening asthma.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gerd/symptoms-causes/syc-20361940
Gastrointestinal bleeding,"Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a sign of a disorder in the digestive tract. The blood often shows up in stool or vomit but isn't always obvious. Stool may look black or tarry. Bleeding can range from mild to severe and can be life-threatening.
Imaging technology or an endoscopic investigation can usually locate the cause of the bleeding. Treatment depends on the where the bleeding is located and how severe it is.","Symptoms ofGIbleeding can be easy to see, called overt, or not so obvious, known as occult. Symptoms depend on the rate of bleeding as well as the location of the bleed, which can be anywhere on theGItract, from where it starts — the mouth — to where it ends — the anus. | Overt bleeding might show up as: | Vomiting blood, which might be red or might be dark brown and look like coffee grounds. | Black, tarry stool. | Rectal bleeding, usually in or with stool. | With occult bleeding, you might have: | Lightheadedness. | Difficulty breathing. | Fainting. | Chest pain. | Abdominal pain.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gastrointestinal-bleeding/symptoms-causes/syc-20372729
Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST),"A gastrointestinal stromal tumor, also called a GIST, is a type of cancer that begins in the digestive system. GISTs happen most often in the stomach and small intestine.
A GIST is a growth of cells that's thought to form from nerve cells in the walls of the digestive organs. The nerve cells play a part in the process that moves food through the body.
Small GISTs may cause no symptoms. And GISTs may grow so slowly that they don't cause problems at first. As a GIST grows, it can cause symptoms that may include belly pain and nausea.
GISTs can happen in people at any age, but they are most common in adults and very rare in children. The cause of most GISTs isn't known.",Gastrointestinal stromal tumor symptoms include: | A growth in the belly area. | Belly pain. | Fatigue. | Nausea and vomiting. | Not feeling hungry when you would expect to. | Feeling full if you eat only a small amount of food. | Dark-colored stools caused by bleeding in the digestive system.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/symptoms-causes/syc-20579528
Gaucher disease,"Gaucher (go-SHAY) disease is the result of a buildup of certain fatty substances in certain organs, particularly your spleen and liver. This causes these organs to enlarge and can affect their function.
The fatty substances also can build up in bone tissue, weakening the bone and increasing the risk of fractures. If the bone marrow is affected, it can interfere with your blood's ability to clot.
An enzyme that breaks down these fatty substances doesn't work properly in people with Gaucher disease. Treatment often includes enzyme replacement therapy.
An inherited disorder, Gaucher disease is most common in Jewish people of Eastern and Central European descent (Ashkenazi). Symptoms can appear at any age.","There are different types of Gaucher disease, and signs and symptoms of disease vary widely, even within the same type. Type 1 is by far the most common. | Siblings, even identical twins, with the disease can have different levels of severity. Some people who have Gaucher disease have only mild or no symptoms. | Most people who have Gaucher disease have varying degrees of the following problems: | Abdominal complaints.Because the liver and especially the spleen can enlarge dramatically, the abdomen can become painfully distended. | Skeletal abnormalities.Gaucher disease can weaken bone, increasing the risk of painful fractures. It can also interfere with the blood supply to your bones, which can cause portions of the bone to die. | Blood disorders.A decrease in healthy red blood cells (anemia) can result in severe fatigue. Gaucher disease also affects the cells responsible for clotting, which can cause easy bruising and nosebleeds. | More rarely, Gaucher disease affects the brain, which can cause abnormal eye movements, muscle rigidity, swallowing difficulties and seizures. One rare subtype of Gaucher disease begins in infancy and typically results in death by 2 years of age.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gauchers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20355546
Gender dysphoria,"Gender dysphoria is a feeling of distress that can happen when a person's gender identity differs from the sex assigned at birth.
Some transgender and gender-diverse people have gender dysphoria at some point in their lives. Other transgender and gender-diverse people feel at ease with their bodies and gender identities, and they don't have gender dysphoria.
A diagnosis for gender dysphoria is included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). TheDSM-5is published by the American Psychiatric Association. The diagnosis was created to help people with gender dysphoria get access to the healthcare and treatment that they need. A diagnosis of gender dysphoria focuses on the feeling of distress as the issue, not gender identity.","Gender identity is having the internal sense of being male or female or being somewhere along the gender spectrum, or having an internal sense of gender that is beyond male and female. People who have gender dysphoria feel a big difference between their gender identity and their sex assigned at birth. Gender dysphoria is different from simply not following stereotypical gender behaviors. It involves feelings of distress due to a strong, lasting desire to be another gender. | Gender dysphoria might start in childhood and continue into the teen years and adulthood. But some people may have periods of time in which they don't notice gender dysphoria. Or the feelings may seem to come and go. Some people have gender dysphoria when puberty starts. In others, it may not develop until later in life. | Some teens might express their feelings of gender dysphoria to their parents or a healthcare professional.

Genital herpes,"Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI). The herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes genital herpes. Genital herpes can often be spread by skin-to-skin contact during sexual activity.
Some people infected with the virus may have very mild symptoms or no symptoms. They can still able to spread the virus. Other people have pain, itching and sores around the genitals, anus or mouth.
There is no cure for genital herpes. Symptoms often show up again after the first outbreak. Medicine can ease symptoms. It also lowers the risk of infecting others. Condoms can help prevent the spread of a genital herpes infection.","Most people infected withHSVdon't know they have it. They may have no symptoms or have very mild symptoms. | Symptoms start about 2 to 12 days after exposure to the virus. They may include: | Pain or itching around the genitals | Small bumps or blisters around the genitals, anus or mouth | Painful ulcers that form when blisters rupture and ooze or bleed | Scabs that form as the ulcers heal | Painful urination | Discharge from the urethra, the tube that releases urine from the body | Discharge from the vagina | During the first outbreak, you may commonly have flu-like symptoms such as: | Fever | Headache | Body aches | Swollen lymph nodes in the groin",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/genital-herpes/symptoms-causes/syc-20356161
Genital warts,"Genital warts are one of the most common types of sexually transmitted infections. The virus that causes the warts is called human papillomavirus (HPV). There are various types ofHPV. And nearly all sexually active people will become infected with at least one type at some point.
Genital warts affect the moist tissues of the genital area. They can look like small, skin-colored bumps. The bumps may resemble cauliflower. Often, the warts are too small to be seen with your eyes.
Some strains of genitalHPVcan cause genital warts. Others can cause cancer. Vaccines can help protect against certain strains of genitalHPV.","Genital warts can grow on the: | Vulva. | Walls of the vagina. | Area between the outer part of the genitals and the anus. | Anal canal. | Cervix. | Tip or shaft of the penis. | Scrotum. | Anus. | Genital warts also can form in the mouth or throat of a person who has had oral sex with an infected person. | The symptoms of genital warts include: | Small swellings in the genital area that may be skin-colored or a different color. | A cauliflower-like shape caused by a few warts close together. | Itching or discomfort in your genital area. | Bleeding with sex. | Genital warts can be so small and flat that you can't see them.

Geographic tongue,"Geographic tongue is an inflammatory but harmless condition affecting the surface of the tongue. The tongue usually is covered with tiny, pinkish-white bumps called papillae. These papillae are actually fine, hairlike structures. With geographic tongue, patches on the surface of the tongue are missing papillae. These patches are smooth and red, often with slightly raised borders.
This condition is called geographic tongue because the patches make your tongue look like a map. The patches often appear in one area and then move to a different part of the tongue.
Although geographic tongue may look alarming, it does not cause health issues. It's not related to infection or cancer. Geographic tongue sometimes can cause tongue pain and make you more sensitive to certain foods, such as spices, salt and even sweets.","Symptoms of geographic tongue may include: | Smooth, red, irregularly shaped patches on the top or side of your tongue. These patches may look like sores. | Frequent changes in the location, size and shape of the patches. | Pain or burning feeling in some cases, most often related to eating spicy or acidic foods. | Many people with geographic tongue have no symptoms. | Geographic tongue can continue for days, months or years.

Germ cell tumors,"Germ cell tumors are growths of cells that form from reproductive cells called germ cells. In the female reproductive system, germ cells turn into eggs. In the male reproductive system, they turn into sperm. Most germ cell tumors happen in the testicles or the ovaries.
Some germ cell tumors happen in other areas of the body, but they are very rare. These are called extragonadal germ cell tumors. Examples of where these tumors can form include the belly, brain and chest. It's not clear why germ cell tumors form in places other than the testicles and ovaries.
Some germ cell tumors may be cancer, but others are not cancer.
Treatment for germ cell tumors may include surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.","Symptoms of germ cell tumors depend on where they happen. Symptoms often happen because a growing tumor puts pressure on nearby tissue or organs. For example, a germ cell tumor in an ovary may lead to pelvic pain, back pain, bloating or swelling in the belly. A germ cell tumor in a testicle may cause swelling or pain in the testicle or scrotum.

Giant cell arteritis,"Giant cell arteritis is an inflammation of the lining of your arteries. Most often, it affects the arteries in your head, especially those in your temples. For this reason, giant cell arteritis is sometimes called temporal arteritis.
Giant cell arteritis frequently causes headaches, scalp tenderness, jaw pain and vision problems. Untreated, it can lead to blindness.
Prompt treatment with corticosteroid medications usually relieves symptoms of giant cell arteritis and might prevent loss of vision. You'll likely begin to feel better within days of starting treatment. But even with treatment, relapses are common.
You'll need to visit your doctor regularly for checkups and treatment of any side effects from taking corticosteroids.","The most common symptoms of giant cell arteritis are head pain and tenderness — often severe — that usually affects both temples. Head pain can progressively worsen, come and go, or subside temporarily. | Generally, signs and symptoms of giant cell arteritis include: | Persistent, severe head pain, usually in your temple area | Scalp tenderness | Jaw pain when you chew or open your mouth wide | Fever | Fatigue | Unintended weight loss | Vision loss or double vision, particularly in people who also have jaw pain | Sudden, permanent loss of vision in one eye | Pain and stiffness in the neck, shoulders or hips are common symptoms of a related disorder, polymyalgia rheumatica.

Castleman disease,"Castleman disease is a group of rare disorders that involves lymph nodes that get bigger, called enlarged lymph nodes, and a wide range of symptoms. The most common form of the disorder involves a single enlarged lymph node. This lymph node is usually in the chest or neck, but it can occur in other areas of the body as well. This form of the disorder is called unicentric Castleman disease (UCD).
Multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) involves multiple regions of enlarged lymph nodes, inflammatory symptoms and problems with organ function. There are three types of MCD:
Sometimes, people may have 2-3 enlarged lymph nodes and mild symptoms that do not meet the diagnostic criteria for MCD. These people may have another disease, or they may have the recently described subtype of Castleman disease called oligocentric Castleman disease. This subtype is rare.
Treatment and outlook vary depending on the type of Castleman disease you have. Unicentric Castleman disease, which is the type that involves only one enlarged lymph node, can usually be successfully treated with surgery.
The best treatment for oligocentric Castleman disease, which involves a few enlarged lymph nodes and has limited symptoms, is not known but is thought to be similar to the treatment for unicentric Castleman disease.
While not all people with MCD respond to the first treatment, there are medicines that work to treat HHV-8-associated MCD and idiopathic MCD.",Many people with unicentric Castleman disease don't notice any signs or symptoms. The enlarged lymph node may be found during a physical exam or an imaging test for a different problem. | Some people with unicentric Castleman disease might have signs and symptoms that are more often seen in multicentric Castleman disease.

It causes irritation, redness, swelling and bleeding of your gingiva, which is the part of your gum around the base of your teeth. It's important to take gingivitis seriously and treat it promptly. Gingivitis does not cause bone loss. But left untreated, it can lead to a much more serious gum disease, called periodontitis, and tooth loss.
The most common cause of gingivitis is not keeping your teeth and gums clean and healthy. Good oral health habits, such as brushing at least twice a day, flossing daily and getting regular dental checkups, can help prevent and reverse gingivitis.","Healthy gums are firm and pale pink.

Glaucoma,"Glaucoma is an eye condition that damages the optic nerve. This damage can lead to vision loss or blindness. The optic nerve sends visual information from your eye to the brain and is vital for good vision. Damage to the optic nerve is often related to high pressure in the eye. But glaucoma can happen even with typical eye pressure.
Glaucoma can happen at any age but is more common in older adults. It is one of the leading causes of blindness for people over the age of 60.
Many forms of glaucoma have no warning signs. The effect is so gradual that you may not notice a change in vision until the condition is in its later stages.
It's important to have regular eye exams that include measurements of your eye pressure. If glaucoma is found early, vision loss can be slowed or prevented. If you have glaucoma, you'll need treatment or monitoring for the rest of your life.",The symptoms of glaucoma depend on the type and stage of the condition.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/glaucoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20372839

Celiac disease,"Celiac disease is an illness caused by an immune reaction to eating gluten. Gluten is a protein found in foods containing wheat, barley or rye.
If you have celiac disease, eating gluten triggers an immune response to the gluten protein in your small intestine. Over time, this reaction damages your small intestine's lining and prevents it from absorbing nutrients, a condition called malabsorption.
The intestinal damage often causes symptoms such as diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, bloating or anemia. It also can lead to serious complications if it is not managed or treated. In children, malabsorption can affect growth and development in addition to gastrointestinal symptoms.
There's no definite cure for celiac disease. But for most people, following a strict gluten-free diet can help manage symptoms and help the intestines heal.","The symptoms of celiac disease can vary greatly. They also may be different in children and adults. Digestive symptoms for adults include: | Diarrhea. | Fatigue. | Weight loss. | Bloating and gas. | Abdominal pain. | Nausea and vomiting. | Constipation. | However, more than half the adults with celiac disease have symptoms that are not related to the digestive system, including: | Anemia, usually from iron deficiency due to decreased iron absorption. | Loss of bone density, called osteoporosis, or softening of bones, called osteomalacia. | Itchy, blistery skin rash, called dermatitis herpetiformis. | Mouth ulcers. | Headaches and fatigue. | Nervous system injury, including numbness and tingling in the feet and hands, possible problems with balance, and cognitive impairment. | Joint pain. | Reduced functioning of the spleen, known as hyposplenism. | Elevated liver enzymes.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/celiac-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352220

Gonorrhea,"Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection, also called a sexually transmitted disease, caused by bacteria. Sexually transmitted diseases are infections spread mainly by contact with genitals or bodily fluids. Also called STDs, STIs or venereal disease, sexually transmitted infections are caused by bacteria, viruses or parasites.
Gonorrhea bacteria can infect the urethra, rectum, female reproductive tract, mouth, throat or eyes. Gonorrhea is most commonly spread during vaginal, oral or anal sexual activity. But babies can get the infection during childbirth. In babies, gonorrhea most commonly affects the eyes.
Avoiding sexual activity and not having sex prevents the spread of gonorrhea. Using a condom during sexual activity can help prevent the spread of gonorrhea. Being in a mutually monogamous relationship, in which both partners have sex only with each other and neither partner is infected, also limits the risk of an infection.","In many people, gonorrhea infection causes no symptoms.

Gout,"Gout is a common and complex form of arthritis that can affect anyone. It's characterized by sudden, severe attacks of pain, swelling, redness and tenderness in one or more joints, most often in the big toe.
An attack of gout can occur suddenly, often waking you up in the middle of the night with the sensation that your big toe is on fire. The affected joint is hot, swollen and so tender that even the weight of the bedsheet on it may seem intolerable.
Gout symptoms may come and go, but there are ways to manage symptoms and prevent flares.","The signs and symptoms of gout almost always occur suddenly, and often at night. They include: | Intense joint pain.Gout usually affects the big toe, but it can occur in any joint. Other commonly affected joints include the ankles, knees, elbows, wrists and fingers. The pain is likely to be most severe within the first four to 12 hours after it begins. | Lingering discomfort.After the most severe pain subsides, some joint discomfort may last from a few days to a few weeks. Later attacks are likely to last longer and affect more joints. | Inflammation and redness.The affected joint or joints become swollen, tender, warm and red. | Limited range of motion.As gout progresses, you may not be able to move your joints normally.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gout/symptoms-causes/syc-20372897
Granuloma annulare,"Granuloma annulare (gran-u-LOW-muh an-u-LAR-e) is a skin condition that causes a raised rash or bumps in a ring pattern. The most common type affects young adults, usually on the hands and feet.
Minor skin injuries and some medicines might trigger the condition. It's not contagious and usually not painful, but it can make you feel self-conscious. And if it becomes a long-term condition, it can cause emotional distress.
Treatment might clear the skin gradually, but the bumps tend to come back. Untreated, the condition might last from a few weeks to decades.","The signs and symptoms of granuloma annulare can vary, depending on the type: | Localized.This is the most common type of granuloma annulare. The rash borders are circular or semicircular, with a diameter up to 2 inches (5 centimeters). The rash occurs most commonly on the hands, feet, wrists and ankles of young adults. | Generalized.This type is uncommon and usually affects adults. It causes bumps that form a rash on most of the body, including the trunk, arms and legs. The rash might cause discomfort or itchiness. | Under the skin.A type that usually affects young children is called subcutaneous granuloma annulare. It produces small, firm lumps under the skin, instead of a rash. The lumps form on the hands, shins and scalp.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/granuloma-annulare/symptoms-causes/syc-20351319
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis,"Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a rare disease that causes swelling, also called inflammation, of small blood vessels. This condition mainly affects blood vessels in the nose, sinuses, throat, lungs and kidneys. But it can affect any organ.
GPA used to be called Wegener granulomatosis. It's one of a group of blood vessel diseases called vasculitis. GPA slows blood flow to some organs. The affected tissues can develop inflamed areas called granulomas. Granulomas can damage these organs and affect how they work.
Symptoms of GPA vary. At first, the symptoms can seem like those of a cold. Other symptoms depend on which organs the disease affects. The cause of GPA isn't clear, but the immune system may play a role.
It's important for healthcare professionals to find and treat GPA as soon as possible. Early treatment can help people live full lives. Without treatment, the condition can lead to organ damage that sometimes is fatal.","Symptoms of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) can vary widely from person to person. Symptoms can start quickly, or they can develop over months. | Early on, GPA can cause general symptoms such as: | Fever. | Tiredness and not feeling well, also called malaise. | Weight loss without a clear reason for it. | Muscle aches and pain. | Joint stiffness. | Specific symptoms depend on what parts of the body GPA affects.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351088
Graves' disease,"Graves' disease is an immune system condition that affects the thyroid gland. It causes the body to make too much thyroid hormone. That condition is called hyperthyroidism.
Thyroid hormones affect many organs in the body. So Graves' disease symptoms also can affect those organs. Anyone can get Graves' disease. But it's more common in women and in people older than 30.
Treatment for Graves' disease helps lower the amount of thyroid hormone that the body makes and eases symptoms.","Common symptoms of Graves' disease include: | Feeling nervous and irritable. | Having a slight tremor of the hands or fingers. | Being sensitive to heat with an increase in sweating or warm, moist skin. | Losing weight, despite wanting to eat more. | Having an enlarged thyroid gland, also called goiter. | Having changes in menstrual cycles. | Not being able to get or keep an erection, called erectile dysfunction, or having less desire for sex. | Having bowel movements often. | Having bulging eyes — a condition called thyroid eye disease or Graves' ophthalmopathy. | Being tired. | Having thick, discolored skin mostly on the shins or tops of the feet, called Graves' dermopathy. | Having fast or irregular heartbeat, called palpitations. | Not sleeping well.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/graves-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356240
Complicated grief,"Losing a loved one is one of the most distressing and, unfortunately, common experiences people face. Most people experiencing normal grief and bereavement have a period of sorrow, numbness, and even guilt and anger. Gradually these feelings ease, and it's possible to accept loss and move forward.
For some people, feelings of loss are debilitating and don't improve even after time passes. This is known as complicated grief, sometimes called persistent complex bereavement disorder. In complicated grief, painful emotions are so long lasting and severe that you have trouble recovering from the loss and resuming your own life.
Different people follow different paths through the grieving experience. The order and timing of these phases may vary from person to person:
These differences are normal. But if you're unable to move through these stages more than a year after the death of a loved one, you may have complicated grief. If so, seek treatment. It can help you come to terms with your loss and reclaim a sense of acceptance and peace.","During the first few months after a loss, many signs and symptoms of normal grief are the same as those of complicated grief. However, while normal grief symptoms gradually start to fade over time, those of complicated grief linger or get worse. Complicated grief is like being in an ongoing, heightened state of mourning that keeps you from healing. | Signs and symptoms of complicated grief may include: | Intense sorrow, pain and rumination over the loss of your loved one | Focus on little else but your loved one's death | Extreme focus on reminders of the loved one or excessive avoidance of reminders | Intense and persistent longing or pining for the deceased | Problems accepting the death | Numbness or detachment | Bitterness about your loss | Feeling that life holds no meaning or purpose | Lack of trust in others | Inability to enjoy life or think back on positive experiences with your loved one | Complicated grief also may be indicated if you continue to: | Have trouble carrying out normal routines | Isolate from others and withdraw from social activities | Experience depression, deep sadness, guilt or self-blame | Believe that you did something wrong or could have prevented the death | Feel life isn't worth living without your loved one | Wish you had died along with your loved one",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/complicated-grief/symptoms-causes/syc-20360374
Blood in urine (hematuria),"It can be scary to see blood in urine, also called hematuria. In many cases, the cause is harmless. But blood in urine also can be a sign of a serious illness.
If you can see the blood, it's called gross hematuria. Blood that can't be seen with the naked eye is called microscopic hematuria. It's such a small amount that it can be seen only under a microscope when a lab tests the urine. Either way, it's important to figure out the reason for the bleeding.
Treatment depends on the cause.","Blood in the urine can look pink, red or cola-colored. Red blood cells cause the urine to change color. It takes only a small amount of blood to turn urine red. | The bleeding often isn't painful.

Acromegaly,"Acromegaly is a rare condition in adults that causes some bones, organs and other tissue to grow bigger. A small gland in the brain called the pituitary gland drives these changes by making too much growth hormone. This usually happens due to a tumor of the pituitary gland. The tumor isn't cancer.
When the body has too much growth hormone, bones get bigger. In childhood, this leads to increased height as part of a condition called gigantism. In adults with acromegaly, a change in height doesn't happen. Instead, bones in the hands, feet and face become bigger.
These changes happen slowly over many years. So people with acromegaly and their loved ones may take a long time to notice the symptoms. And healthcare professionals may have a hard time finding and treating the condition early on.
Without treatment, acromegaly can lead to other serious and sometimes life-threatening health conditions called complications. But treatments such as surgery, medicine and radiation can lower the risk of complications. Treatment also can improve many acromegaly symptoms.","Acromegaly symptoms can change the way some body parts look. Changes can include: | Thick ears and lips. | A broad nose. | Enlarged hands and feet. | A jutting brow or jaw. | Gaps between teeth. | An enlarged tongue. | An expanded rib cage that may cause the chest to have a round shape. | Skin changes can include: | Acne. | Harmless skin growths called skin tags. | Coarse, oily and thickened skin. | Swelling in the tissue under the skin. | Most often, people with acromegaly don't have every possible body change. And because the changes come on slowly, they may take years to notice. But over time, rings may no longer fit fingers like they used to. Or shoe size may get bigger. Sometimes, people notice the changes only by comparing old photos with newer ones. | Other acromegaly symptoms can include: | Vision troubles, including loss of side vision. | More sweating and body odor than is typical. | Extreme tiredness. | Headaches. | Joint pain. | Deeper voice.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acromegaly/symptoms-causes/syc-20351222
Growth plate fractures,"A growth plate fracture affects the layer of growing tissue near the ends of a child's bones. Growth plates are the softest and weakest sections of the skeleton — sometimes even weaker than surrounding ligaments and tendons. An injury that might cause a joint sprain for an adult can cause a growth plate fracture in a child.
Growth plate fractures often need immediate treatment because they can affect how the bone will grow. An improperly treated growth plate fracture could result in a fractured bone ending up more crooked or shorter than its opposite limb. With proper treatment, most growth plate fractures heal without complications.","Most growth plate fractures occur in bones of the fingers, forearm and lower leg. Signs and symptoms of a growth plate fracture may include: | Pain and tenderness, particularly in response to pressure on the growth plate | Inability to move the affected area or to put weight or pressure on the limb | Warmth and swelling at the end of a bone, near a joint | If you suspect a fracture, take your child to be examined by a doctor. Also have your child evaluated if you notice a visible deformity in your child's arms or legs, or if your child is having trouble playing sports because of persistent pain.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/growth-plate-fractures/symptoms-causes/syc-20351979
Guillain-Barre syndrome,"Guillain-Barre (gee-YAH-buh-RAY) syndrome is a condition in which the body's immune system attacks the nerves. It can cause weakness, numbness or paralysis.
Weakness and tingling in the hands and feet are usually the first symptoms. These sensations can quickly spread and may lead to paralysis. In its most serious form, Guillain-Barre syndrome is a medical emergency. Most people with the condition need treatment in a hospital.
Guillain-Barre syndrome is rare, and the exact cause is not known. But two-thirds of people have symptoms of an infection in the six weeks before Guillain-Barre symptoms begin. Infections can include a respiratory or a gastrointestinal infection, includingCOVID-19. Guillain-Barre also can be caused by the Zika virus.
There's no known cure for Guillain-Barre syndrome. Several treatment options can ease symptoms and help speed recovery. Most people recover completely from Guillain-Barre syndrome, but some serious illnesses can be fatal. While recovery may take up to several years, most people are able to walk again six months after symptoms first began. Some people may have lasting effects, such as weakness, numbness or fatigue.","Guillain-Barre syndrome often begins with tingling and weakness starting in the feet and legs and spreading to the upper body and arms. Some people notice the first symptoms in the arms or face. As Guillain-Barre syndrome progresses, muscle weakness can turn into paralysis. | Symptoms of Guillain-Barre syndrome may include: | A pins and needles feeling in the fingers, toes, ankles or wrists. | Weakness in the legs that spreads to the upper body. | Unsteady walk or not being able to walk or climb stairs. | Trouble with facial movements, including speaking, chewing or swallowing. | Double vision or inability to move the eyes. | Severe pain that may feel achy, shooting or cramplike and may be worse at night. | Trouble with bladder control or bowel function. | Rapid heart rate. | Low or high blood pressure. | Trouble breathing. | People with Guillain-Barre syndrome usually experience their most significant weakness within two weeks after symptoms begin.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/guillain-barre-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20362793
Periodontitis,"Periodontitis (per-e-o-don-TIE-tis), also called gum disease, is a serious gum infection that damages the soft tissue around teeth. Without treatment, periodontitis can destroy the bone that supports your teeth. This can cause teeth to loosen or lead to tooth loss.
Periodontitis is common but can usually be prevented. It's often the result of not taking care of your mouth and teeth. To help prevent periodontitis or improve your chance of successful treatment, brush at least twice a day, floss daily and get regular dental checkups.","Healthy gums are firm and fit snugly around teeth.

Enlarged breasts in men (gynecomastia),"Gynecomastia (guy-nuh-koh-MAS-tee-uh) is an increase in the amount of breast gland tissue in boys or men. An imbalance of the hormones estrogen and testosterone causes it. Gynecomastia can affect one or both breasts, sometimes unevenly.
Pseudogynecomastia is an increase in fat but not gland tissue in male breasts.
Newborns, boys going through puberty and older men may develop gynecomastia due to natural changes in hormone levels. There are other causes too.
Most often, gynecomastia isn't a serious problem. But it can be tough to cope with the condition. People with gynecomastia sometimes have pain in their breasts. And they may feel embarrassed.

During the 2009-10 flu season, a new H1N1 virus began causing illness in humans. It was often called swine flu and was a new combination of influenza viruses that infect pigs, birds and humans.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the H1N1 flu to be a pandemic in 2009. That year the virus caused an estimated 284,400 deaths worldwide. In August 2010,WHOdeclared the pandemic over. But the H1N1 flu strain from the pandemic became one of the strains that cause seasonal flu.

Hair loss,"Hair loss (alopecia) can affect just your scalp or your entire body, and it can be temporary or permanent. It can be the result of heredity, hormonal changes, medical conditions or a normal part of aging. Anyone can lose hair on their head, but it's more common in men.
Baldness typically refers to excessive hair loss from your scalp. Hereditary hair loss with age is the most common cause of baldness. Some people prefer to let their hair loss run its course untreated and unhidden. Others may cover it up with hairstyles, makeup, hats or scarves. And still others choose one of the treatments available to prevent further hair loss or restore growth.
Before pursuing hair loss treatment, talk with your doctor about the cause of your hair loss and treatment options.","Hair loss can appear in many different ways, depending on what's causing it.

Pulling out hair from the scalp often leaves patchy bald spots. This can cause a lot of distress and can affect your work, school and social life. You may go to great lengths to hide the hair loss.
For some people, trichotillomania may be mild and can be managed. For others, the automatic or deliberate urge to pull out hair is too much to handle emotionally. Some treatment options may help reduce hair pulling or stop it entirely.","Symptoms of trichotillomania often include: | Repeatedly pulling out your hair, whether it's automatic or on purpose, usually from your scalp, eyebrows or eyelashes, but sometimes from other body areas.

Arteriosclerosis / atherosclerosis,"Arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis are sometimes used to mean the same thing. But there's a difference between the two terms.
Arteriosclerosishappens when the blood vessels that carry oxygen and nutrients from the heart to the rest of the body become thick and stiff. These blood vessels are called arteries. Healthy arteries are flexible and elastic. But over time, the walls in the arteries can harden, a condition commonly called hardening of the arteries.
Atherosclerosisis a specific type of arteriosclerosis.
Atherosclerosis is the buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the artery walls. This buildup is called plaque. The plaque can cause arteries to narrow, blocking blood flow. The plaque also can burst, leading to a blood clot.
Although atherosclerosis is often considered a heart condition, it can affect arteries anywhere in the body. Atherosclerosis can be treated. Healthy lifestyle habits can help prevent atherosclerosis.","Mild atherosclerosis usually doesn't cause symptoms. | Atherosclerosis symptoms usually don't happen until an artery is so narrowed or clogged that it can't send enough blood to organs and tissues. Sometimes a blood clot completely blocks blood flow. The clot may break apart. If this happens, it may cause a heart attack or stroke. | Symptoms of moderate to severe atherosclerosis depend on which arteries are affected. For example, if you have atherosclerosis: | In your heart arteries,you may have chest pain or pressure, called angina. | In the arteries leading to your brain,you may have sudden numbness or weakness in your arms or legs, trouble speaking, slurred speech, sudden or temporary loss of vision in one eye, or drooping muscles in your face. These are symptoms of a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Untreated, a TIA can lead to a stroke. | In the arteries in your arms and legs,you may have leg pain when walking, called claudication. This is a symptom of peripheral artery disease (PAD). You also might have lower blood pressure in the affected arm or leg. | In the arteries leading to your kidneys,you may get high blood pressure or kidney failure.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569

Hepatitis A,"Hepatitis A is a highly contagious liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus. The virus is one of several types of hepatitis viruses that cause liver inflammation and affect your liver's ability to function.
You're most likely to get hepatitis A from contaminated food or water or from close contact with a person or object that's infected. Mild cases of hepatitis A don't require treatment. Most people who are infected recover completely with no permanent liver damage.
Practicing good hygiene, including washing hands frequently, can prevent the spread of the virus. The hepatitis A vaccine can protect against hepatitis A.","Hepatitis A symptoms typically appear a few weeks after you've had the virus. But not everyone with hepatitis A develops symptoms. If you do, symptoms can include: | Unusual tiredness and weakness | Sudden nausea and vomiting and diarrhea | Abdominal pain or discomfort, especially on the upper right side beneath your lower ribs, which is over your liver | Clay- or gray-colored stool | Loss of appetite | Low-grade fever | Dark urine | Joint pain | Yellowing of the skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice) | Intense itching | These symptoms may be relatively mild and go away in a few weeks. Sometimes, however, hepatitis A results in a severe illness that lasts several months.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hepatitis-a/symptoms-causes/syc-20367007
Hay fever,"Hay fever, also called allergic rhinitis, causes cold-like symptoms. These may include a runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, sneezing and sinus pressure. But unlike a cold, hay fever isn't caused by a virus. Hay fever is caused by an allergic response to a harmless outdoor or indoor substance the body identifies as harmful (allergen).
Common allergens that can trigger hay fever symptoms include pollen and dust mites. Tiny flecks of skin shed by cats, dogs, and other animals with fur or feathers (pet dander) also can be allergens.
Besides making you miserable, hay fever can affect how well you perform at work or school and can generally interfere with your life. But you don't have to put up with annoying symptoms. You can learn to avoid triggers and find the right treatment.","Hay fever symptoms can include: | Runny nose and nasal stuffiness, called congestion. | Watery, itchy, red eyes. | Sneezing. | Cough. | Itchy nose, roof of mouth or throat. | Mucus that runs down the back of the throat, called postnasal drip. | Swollen, bruised-appearing skin under the eyes, known as allergic shiners. | Extreme tiredness and fatigue, often due to poor sleep.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hay-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20373039
Hepatitis B,"Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). For most people, hepatitis B is short term, also called acute. Acute hepatitis B lasts less than six months. But for others, the infection lasts more than six months and is called chronic. Chronic hepatitis B raises the risk of liver failure, liver cancer and serious scarring of the liver called cirrhosis.
Most adults with hepatitis B recover fully, even if their symptoms are bad. Infants and children are more likely to develop a chronic, long-lasting hepatitis B virus infection.
A vaccine can prevent infection with the hepatitis B virus. For those who get infected, treatment depends on whether the infection is acute or chronic. Some people need medicine. Others with serious liver damage from a chronic infection need a liver transplant. If you're infected, taking certain safety measures can help prevent spreading the virus to others.","Symptoms of acute hepatitis B range from mild to serious. The symptoms usually start about 1 to 4 months after you've been infected withHBV. But you could notice them as early as two weeks after you're infected. Some people with acute or chronic hepatitis B may not have any symptoms, especially young children. | Hepatitis B symptoms may include: | Pain in the stomach area, also called the abdomen. | Dark urine. | Fever. | Joint pain. | Loss of appetite. | Upset stomach and vomiting. | Weakness and extreme tiredness. | Jaundice, which is a yellowing of the whites of the eyes and the skin. Depending on skin color, this change may be harder or easier to see.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hepatitis-b/symptoms-causes/syc-20366802
Hepatitis C,"Hepatitis C is a viral infection that causes liver swelling, called inflammation. Hepatitis C can lead to serious liver damage. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) spreads through contact with blood that has the virus in it.
Newer antiviral medicines are the treatment of choice for most people with the ongoing, called chronic, hepatitis C infection. These medicines often can cure chronic hepatitis C.
But many people with hepatitis C don't know they have it. That's mainly because symptoms can take decades to appear. So, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that all adults ages 18 to 79 years be screened for hepatitis C.
Screening is for everyone, even those who don't have symptoms or known liver disease.","Every long-term hepatitis C infection starts with what's called an acute phase. Acute hepatitis C usually isn't diagnosed because it rarely causes symptoms. When there are symptoms in this phase, they may include jaundice, fatigue, nausea, fever and muscle aches. | Long-term infection with the hepatitis C virus is called chronic hepatitis C. Chronic hepatitis C usually has no symptoms for many years. Symptoms appear only after the virus damages the liver enough to cause them. | Symptoms can include: | Bleeding easily. | Bruising easily. | Fatigue. | Not wanting to eat. | Yellowing of the skin, called jaundice. This might show up more in white people. Also, yellowing of the whites of the eyes in white, Black and brown people. | Dark-colored urine. | Itchy skin. | Fluid buildup in the stomach area, called ascites. | Swelling in the legs. | Weight loss. | Confusion, drowsiness and slurred speech, called hepatic encephalopathy. | Spiderlike blood vessels on the skin, called spider angiomas. | Acute hepatitis C infection doesn't always become chronic. Some people clear the infection from their bodies after the acute phase. This is called spontaneous viral clearance. Antiviral therapy also helps clear acute hepatitis C.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hepatitis-c/symptoms-causes/syc-20354278
Head and neck cancers,"Head and neck cancers are cancers that start in the head and neck area. There are many kinds of cancer that can happen in the head and neck. Each kind begins as a growth of cells that can invade and destroy healthy body tissue.
Head and neck cancer often refers to cancers that start in the mouth, throat, sinuses and salivary glands. But other cancers can happen in the head and neck and are sometimes considered part of this category too.
Head and neck cancer isn't a diagnosis. Instead, it's a category of cancers that have some things in common. For example, many head and neck cancers share some risk factors and treatments. Most head and neck cancers begin in squamous cells. These thin, flat cells make up the outer layer of the skin. They also line the inside of the nose, mouth and throat. Cancers that begin in the squamous cells are called squamous cell carcinomas. Cancers can begin in other kinds of cells in the head and neck area, though these are less common.
Which treatment you'll have for your head and neck cancer depends on many factors. These might include the location of the cancer, its size and the type of cells involved. Your healthcare team also considers your overall health. Treatment options might include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and others.","Head and neck cancer symptoms may include a sore in the mouth and pain when swallowing. Symptoms might depend on where the cancer starts. Head and neck cancers include cancers that start in the mouth, throat, sinuses and salivary glands. | Symptoms in the mouth and throat: | A lump in the neck that you might be able to feel through the skin. Typically the lump isn't painful. | A sore in the mouth that won't heal. | Coughing up blood. | Hoarse voice. | Loose teeth. | Pain when swallowing. | Symptoms in the nose: | Nosebleeds. | Stuffy or blocked nose that doesn't go away. | Other symptoms: | A sore on the skin of the face, neck or lips that doesn't heal. | Ear pain. | Losing weight without trying.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/head-and-neck-cancers/symptoms-causes/syc-20354171

Coma,"Coma is a state of prolonged loss of consciousness. It can have a variety of causes, including traumatic head injury, stroke, brain tumor, or drug or alcohol intoxication. A coma may even be caused by an underlying illness, such as diabetes or an infection.
Coma is a medical emergency. Quick action is needed to preserve life and brain function. Healthcare professionals typically order a series of blood tests and a brain scan to try to learn what's causing the coma so that proper treatment can begin.
A coma doesn't usually last longer than several weeks. People who are unconscious for a longer time might transition to a lasting vegetative state, known as a persistent vegetative state, or brain death.","The symptoms of a coma commonly include: | Closed eyes. | Depressed brainstem reflexes, such as pupils not responding to light. | No responses of limbs except for reflex movements. | No response to painful stimuli except for reflex movements. | Irregular breathing.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coma/symptoms-causes/syc-20371099
Chronic daily headaches,"Most people have headaches from time to time. But if you have a headache more days than not, you might have chronic daily headaches.
Rather than a specific headache type, chronic daily headaches include a variety of headache subtypes. Chronic refers to how often the headaches occur and how long the condition lasts.
The constant nature of chronic daily headaches makes them one of the most disabling headache conditions. Aggressive initial treatment and steady, long-term management might reduce pain and lead to fewer headaches.","By definition, chronic daily headaches occur 15 days or more a month, for longer than three months. True (primary) chronic daily headaches aren't caused by another condition. | There are short-lasting and long-lasting chronic daily headaches. Long-lasting headaches last more than four hours.

Cluster headache,"Cluster headache is a very painful type of headache. It usually occurs in periods of frequent attacks known as clusters. Cluster headaches can wake people from sleep. These headaches cause intense pain in or around one eye on one side of the head.
Cluster periods can last from weeks to months. Then usually the headaches stop for a period of time, which may last for months or years.
Cluster headache is rare. Treatments can shorten cluster headache attacks and lessen the pain. Also, medicines can reduce the number of cluster headaches.",,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cluster-headache/symptoms-causes/syc-20352080

Migraine,"A migraine is a headache that can cause severe throbbing pain or a pulsing sensation, usually on one side of the head. It's often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. Migraine attacks can last for hours to days, and the pain can be so bad that it interferes with your daily activities.
For some people, a warning symptom known as an aura occurs before or with the headache. An aura can include visual disturbances, such as flashes of light or blind spots, or other disturbances, such as tingling on one side of the face or in an arm or leg and difficulty speaking.
Medications can help prevent some migraines and make them less painful. The right medicines, combined with self-help remedies and lifestyle changes, might help.","Migraines, which affect children and teenagers as well as adults, can progress through four stages: prodrome, aura, attack and post-drome.

Tension headache,"A tension-type headache causes mild to moderate pain that's often described as feeling like a tight band around the head. A tension-type headache is the most common type of headache, yet its causes aren't well understood.
Treatments are available. Managing a tension-type headache is often a balance between practicing healthy habits, finding effective nonmedicine treatments and using medicines appropriately.","Symptoms of a tension-type headache include: | Dull, aching head pain. | Feeling of tightness or pressure across the forehead or on the sides and back of the head. | Tenderness in the scalp, neck and shoulder muscles. | Tension-type headaches are divided into two main categories — episodic and chronic.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tension-headache/symptoms-causes/syc-20353977
Thunderclap headaches,"Thunderclap headaches live up to their name, striking suddenly like a clap of thunder. The pain of these severe headaches peaks within 60 seconds.
Thunderclap headaches are uncommon, but they can warn of potentially life-threatening conditions — usually having to do with bleeding in and around the brain. Seek emergency medical attention for a thunderclap headache.","Thunderclap headaches are dramatic.

Illness anxiety disorder,"Illness anxiety disorder, sometimes called hypochondriasis or health anxiety, is worrying excessively that you are or may become seriously ill. You may have no physical symptoms. Or you may believe that normal body sensations or minor symptoms are signs of severe illness, even though a thorough medical exam doesn't reveal a serious medical condition.
You may experience extreme anxiety that body sensations, such as muscle twitching or fatigue, are associated with a specific, serious illness. This excessive anxiety — rather than the physical symptom itself — results in severe distress that can disrupt your life.
Illness anxiety disorder is a long-term condition that can fluctuate in severity. It may increase with age or during times of stress. But psychological counseling (psychotherapy) and sometimes medication can help ease your worries.","Symptoms of illness anxiety disorder involve preoccupation with the idea that you're seriously ill, based on normal body sensations (such as a noisy stomach) or minor signs (such as a minor rash). Signs and symptoms may include: | Being preoccupied with having or getting a serious disease or health condition | Worrying that minor symptoms or body sensations mean you have a serious illness | Being easily alarmed about your health status | Finding little or no reassurance from doctor visits or negative test results | Worrying excessively about a specific medical condition or your risk of developing a medical condition because it runs in your family | Having so much distress about possible illnesses that it's hard for you to function | Repeatedly checking your body for signs of illness or disease | Frequently making medical appointments for reassurance — or avoiding medical care for fear of being diagnosed with a serious illness | Avoiding people, places or activities for fear of health risks | Constantly talking about your health and possible illnesses | Frequently searching the internet for causes of symptoms or possible illnesses",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/illness-anxiety-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20373782
Hearing loss,"Hearing loss that comes on little by little as you age, also known as presbycusis, is common. More than half the people in the United States older than age 75 have some age-related hearing loss.
There are three types of hearing loss:
Aging and being around loud noises both can cause hearing loss. Other factors, such as too much earwax, can lower how well ears work for a time.
You usually can't get hearing back. But there are ways to improve what you hear.","Symptoms of hearing loss may include: | Muffling of speech and other sounds. | Trouble understanding words, especially when in a crowd or a noisy place. | Trouble hearing the letters of the alphabet that aren't vowels. | Often asking others to speak more slowly, clearly and loudly. | Needing to turn up the volume of the television or radio. | Staying clear of some social settings. | Being bothered by background noise. | Ringing in the ears, known as tinnitus.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hearing-loss/symptoms-causes/syc-20373072
Heart arrhythmia,"A heart arrhythmia (uh-RITH-me-uh) is an irregular heartbeat. A heart arrhythmia occurs when the electrical signals that tell the heart to beat don't work properly. The heart may beat too fast or too slow. Or the pattern of the heartbeat may be inconsistent.
A heart arrhythmia may feel like a fluttering, pounding or racing heartbeat. Some heart arrhythmias are harmless. Others may cause life-threatening symptoms.
There are times when it is OK to have a fast or slow heartbeat. For example, the heart may beat faster with exercise or slow down during sleep.
Heart arrhythmia treatment may include medicines, devices such as pacemakers, or a procedure or surgery. The goals of treatment are to control or get rid of fast, slow or otherwise irregular heartbeats. A heart-healthy lifestyle can help prevent heart damage that can trigger some heart arrhythmias.","A heart arrhythmia may not cause any symptoms. The irregular heartbeat may be noticed during a health checkup for another reason. | Symptoms of an arrhythmia may include: | A fluttering, pounding or racing feeling in the chest. | A fast heartbeat. | A slow heartbeat. | Chest pain. | Shortness of breath. | Other symptoms may include: | Anxiety. | Feeling very tired. | Lightheadedness or dizziness. | Sweating. | Fainting or almost fainting.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-arrhythmia/symptoms-causes/syc-20350668

Congenital heart disease in adults,"Congenital heart disease is one or more problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. Congenital means that you're born with the condition. A congenital heart condition can change the way blood flows through the heart.
There are many different types of congenital heart defects. This article focuses on congenital heart disease in adults.
Some types of congenital heart disease may be mild. Others may cause life-threatening complications. Advances in diagnosis and treatment have improved survival for those born with a heart problem.
Treatment for congenital heart disease may include regular health checkups, medicines or surgery. If you have adult congenital heart disease, ask your healthcare professional how often you need a checkup.","Some people born with a heart problem don't notice symptoms until later in life. Symptoms also may return years after a congenital heart defect is treated. | Common congenital heart disease symptoms in adults include: | Irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias. | Blue or gray skin, lips and fingernails due to low oxygen levels.

Heart failure,"Heart failure occurs when the heart muscle doesn't pump blood as well as it should. When this happens, blood often backs up and fluid can build up in the lungs, causing shortness of breath.
Some heart conditions slowly leave the heart too weak or stiff to fill and pump blood properly. These conditions include narrowed arteries in the heart and high blood pressure.
Proper treatment may improve the symptoms of heart failure and may help some people live longer. Lifestyle changes can improve quality of life. Try to lose weight, exercise, use less salt and manage stress.
But heart failure can be life-threatening. People with heart failure may have severe symptoms. Some may need a heart transplant or a device to help the heart pump blood.
Heart failure also may be called congestive heart failure.","If you have heart failure, your heart can't supply enough blood to meet your body's needs. | Symptoms may develop slowly.

Heart valve disease,"In heart valve disease, one or more of the valves in the heart doesn't work properly. There are four heart valves. They keep blood flowing through the heart in the correct direction. Sometimes a valve doesn't open or close all the way. This can change how blood flows through the heart to the rest of the body.
Heart valve disease treatment depends on the heart valve affected and the type and severity of the disease. Sometimes surgery is needed to repair or replace the heart valve.","Some people with heart valve disease might not have symptoms for many years. When symptoms occur, they might include: | Shortness of breath at rest or when active or lying down. | Fatigue. | Chest pain. | Dizziness. | Swelling of the ankles and feet. | Fainting. | Irregular heartbeat.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-valve-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353727

Causes of heat illness include exposure to high temperatures, particularly when there is also high humidity, and strenuous physical activity. Without prompt treatment, heat exhaustion can lead to heatstroke, a life-threatening condition. Fortunately, heat exhaustion is preventable.","Symptoms of heat exhaustion may start suddenly or progress over time, especially with prolonged periods of exercise. Possible heat exhaustion symptoms include: | Cool, moist skin with goose bumps when in the heat. | Heavy sweating. | Faintness. | Dizziness. | Fatigue. | Weak, rapid pulse. | Low blood pressure upon standing. | Muscle cramps. | Nausea. | Headache.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heat-exhaustion/symptoms-causes/syc-20373250

Heatstroke,"Heatstroke is a condition caused by the body overheating. This usually happens because of exposure to high temperatures or physical activity in high temperatures for too long. There are a few stages of heat injury, and heatstroke is the most serious. It can happen if body temperature rises to 104 F (40 C) or higher. Heatstroke is most common in the summer months.
Heatstroke needs emergency care. If it's not treated, heatstroke can quickly damage the brain, heart, kidneys and muscles. This damage gets worse the longer treatment is delayed, which increases the risk of serious complications or death.","Heatstroke symptoms include: | High body temperature.A core body temperature of 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius) or higher is the main sign of heatstroke. | Change in mental state or behavior.Confusion, agitation, slurred speech, irritability, delirium, seizures and coma can all result from heatstroke. | Change in sweating pattern.In heatstroke brought on by hot weather, skin feels hot and dry to the touch.

Heavy menstrual bleeding,"Some women have menstrual bleeding that is heavy or lasts for more than a few days. This condition used to be called menorrhagia. Heavy menstrual bleeding is a common concern. But most women don't have enough blood loss for it to be called heavy menstrual bleeding.
Some women have menstrual bleeding between periods, or earlier or later in their cycles than expected. This type of bleeding is called abnormal uterine bleeding or irregular menstrual bleeding.
With heavy menstrual bleeding, blood flow and cramping make it harder to do your usual activities. If you dread your period because you have heavy menstrual bleeding, talk with your doctor. There are many treatments that can help.","Symptoms of heavy menstrual bleeding may include: | Soaking through one or more sanitary pads or tampons every hour for several hours in a row. | Needing double sanitary protection to control your menstrual flow. | Getting up at night to change sanitary pads or tampons. | Bleeding for more than a week. | Passing blood clots larger than a quarter. | Limiting daily activities due to heavy menstrual flow. | Feeling tired, fatigued or short of breath as the result of blood loss.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menorrhagia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352829
Plantar fasciitis,"Plantar fasciitis (PLAN-tur fas-e-I-tis) is one of the most common causes of heel pain. It involves inflammation of a thick band of tissue that runs across the bottom of each foot and connects the heel bone to the toes, known as the plantar fascia.
Plantar fasciitis commonly causes stabbing pain that often occurs with your first steps in the morning. As you get up and move, the pain normally decreases, but it might return after long periods of standing or when you stand up after sitting.
The cause of plantar fasciitis is poorly understood. It is more common in runners and in people who are overweight.","Plantar fasciitis typically causes a stabbing pain in the bottom of your foot near the heel.

Hemangioma,"A hemangioma (he-man-jee-O-muh), also known as an infantile hemangioma or hemangioma of infancy, is a bright red birthmark. It looks like a rubbery bump or flat red patch and is made up of extra blood vessels in the skin. The mark shows up at birth or in the first month of life.
A hemangioma typically appears on the face, scalp, chest or back, though it can be anywhere on the skin. Treatment generally isn't needed for a baby's hemangioma, as the mark fades over time. Typically, there is little trace of it by age 10. You may want to think about treatment for the child if a hemangioma leads to problems with vision, breathing or other bodily functions. You also may think about treatment if the hemangioma is in a cosmetically sensitive area.","A hemangioma may be visible at birth, but it appears more often during the first month of life. It starts as a flat red mark on the body, most often on the face, scalp, chest or back. A child generally only has one mark, but some children may have more than one mark. | During your child's first year, the red mark may grow rapidly into a spongy, rubbery-looking bump that sticks out from the skin. The hemangioma then enters a rest phase. Then it will begin to slowly go away. | Many hemangiomas go away by age 5, and most go away by age 10.

Intracranial hematoma,"An intracranial hematoma is a collection of blood within the skull. The blood may collect in the brain tissue or underneath the skull, pressing on the brain. It's usually caused by a blood vessel that bursts in the brain. It also may be caused by a head injury due to a car accident or fall.
Some head injuries, such as one that causes only a short period of unconsciousness, can be minor. However, an intracranial hematoma is potentially life-threatening. It usually requires immediate treatment. This might include surgery to remove the blood.","Symptoms of an intracranial hematoma may develop right after a head injury, or they may take weeks or longer to appear. There may be a period of time without symptoms after a head injury. This is called the lucid interval. | Over time, pressure on the brain increases, producing some or all of the following symptoms: | Headache that gets worse. | Vomiting. | Drowsiness and gradual loss of consciousness. | Dizziness. | Confusion. | Pupils that are different sizes. | Slurred speech. | Loss of movement, known as paralysis, on the opposite side of the body from the head injury.As more blood fills the brain or the narrow space between the brain and skull, other symptoms may appear, such as:Feeling very sleepy or sluggish.Seizures.Loss of consciousness. | Feeling very sleepy or sluggish. | Seizures. | Loss of consciousness.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/intracranial-hematoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20356145
Blood in urine (hematuria),"It can be scary to see blood in urine, also called hematuria. In many cases, the cause is harmless. But blood in urine also can be a sign of a serious illness.
If you can see the blood, it's called gross hematuria. Blood that can't be seen with the naked eye is called microscopic hematuria. It's such a small amount that it can be seen only under a microscope when a lab tests the urine. Either way, it's important to figure out the reason for the bleeding.
Treatment depends on the cause.","Blood in the urine can look pink, red or cola-colored. Red blood cells cause the urine to change color. It takes only a small amount of blood to turn urine red. | The bleeding often isn't painful. But if blood clots get passed in the urine, that can hurt.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/blood-in-urine/symptoms-causes/syc-20353432
Hemifacial spasm,Hemifacial spasm is a nervous system condition in which the muscles on one side of the face twitch. The cause of hemifacial spasm is most often a blood vessel touching or pulsing against a facial nerve. A facial nerve injury or a tumor also can cause it. Sometimes there is no known cause.,"Common symptoms of hemifacial spasm include jerking of muscles in the face that are most often: | On one side of the face. | Not controllable. | Painless. | These muscle movements, also called contractions, often start in the eyelid. Then they might move on to the cheek and mouth on the same side of the face. At first, hemifacial spasms come and go.

Hemochromatosis,"Hemochromatosis (he-moe-kroe-muh-TOE-sis) is a condition that causes the body to absorb too much iron from food. Excess iron is stored in the organs, especially the liver, heart and pancreas. Too much iron can lead to life-threatening conditions, such as liver disease, heart problems and diabetes.
There are a few types of hemochromatosis, but the most common type is caused by a gene change passed down through families. Only a few people who have the genes ever develop serious problems. Symptoms usually appear in midlife.
Treatment includes regularly removing blood from the body. Because much of the body's iron is contained in red blood cells, this treatment lowers iron levels.",Some people with hemochromatosis never have symptoms. Early symptoms often overlap with those of other common conditions. | Symptoms may include: | Joint pain. | Belly pain. | Fatigue. | Weakness. | Diabetes. | Loss of sex drive. | Impotence. | Heart failure. | Liver failure. | Bronze or gray skin color. | Memory fog.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemochromatosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351443
Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS),"Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a condition that can occur when small blood vessels become damaged and inflamed. This damage can cause clots to form in the vessels all through the body. The clots can damage the kidneys and other organs. Hemolytic uremic syndrome can lead to kidney failure, which can be life-threatening.
Anyone can get hemolytic uremic syndrome. But it's most common in young children. Most often, infection with certain strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria is the cause.
Other infections, certain medicines or conditions such as pregnancy, cancer or autoimmune diseases can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome. It also can be the result of certain gene changes.
Hemolytic uremic syndrome is serious. But treating it in time leads to a full recovery for most people, especially young children.","The symptoms of hemolytic uremic syndrome vary, depending on the cause. The first symptoms of hemolytic uremic syndrome caused by E. coli bacteria might include: | Diarrhea, which is often bloody. | Pain, cramping or bloating in the stomach area. | Fever. | Vomiting. | All forms of hemolytic uremic syndrome damage blood vessels. This damage causes red blood cells to break down, called anemia. The condition also causes blood clots to form in the blood vessels and, in turn, damage the kidneys. | Symptoms of these changes include: | Loss of color in the skin. | Extreme tiredness. | Easy bruising. | Unusual bleeding, such as bleeding from the nose and mouth. | Decreased urinating or blood in the urine. | Swelling, called edema, of the legs, feet or ankles. Swelling occurs less often in the face, hands, feet or entire body. | Confusion, seizures or stroke. | High blood pressure.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemolytic-uremic-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20352399
Hemophilia,"Hemophilia is a rare disorder in which the blood doesn't clot in the typical way because it doesn't have enough blood-clotting proteins (clotting factors). If you have hemophilia, you might bleed for a longer time after an injury than you would if your blood clotted properly.
Small cuts usually aren't much of a problem. If you have a severe form of the condition, the main concern is bleeding inside your body, especially in your knees, ankles and elbows. Internal bleeding can damage your organs and tissues and be life-threatening.
Hemophilia is almost always a genetic disorder. Treatment includes regular replacement of the specific clotting factor that is reduced. Newer therapies that don't contain clotting factors also are being used.","Signs and symptoms of hemophilia vary, depending on your level of clotting factors. If your clotting-factor level is mildly reduced, you might bleed only after surgery or trauma. If your deficiency is severe, you can bleed easily for seemingly no reason. | Signs and symptoms of spontaneous bleeding include: | Unexplained and excessive bleeding from cuts or injuries, or after surgery or dental work | Many large or deep bruises | Unusual bleeding after vaccinations | Pain, swelling or tightness in your joints | Blood in your urine or stool | Nosebleeds without a known cause | In infants, unexplained irritability",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemophilia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373327
Hemorrhoids,"Hemorrhoids (HEM-uh-roids), also called piles, are swollen veins in the anus and lower rectum. Hemorrhoids are similar to varicose veins. Hemorrhoids can develop inside the rectum, called internal hemorrhoids. They also can develop under the skin around the anus, called external hemorrhoids.
There are several options available to treat hemorrhoids. Many people get relief with home treatments and lifestyle changes.",Symptoms of hemorrhoids usually depend on the type of hemorrhoid.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemorrhoids/symptoms-causes/syc-20360268

Autoimmune hepatitis,"Autoimmune hepatitis is a liver disease that happens when the body's immune system attacks the liver. This can cause swelling, irritation and damage to the liver. The exact cause of autoimmune hepatitis is unclear, but genetic and environmental factors appear to interact over time to trigger the disease.
Untreated autoimmune hepatitis can lead to scarring of the liver, called cirrhosis. It can also eventually lead to liver failure. When diagnosed and treated early, however, autoimmune hepatitis often can be controlled with medicines that suppress the immune system.
A liver transplant may be an option when autoimmune hepatitis doesn't respond to medicines or liver disease becomes advanced.","Symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis vary from person to person and may come on suddenly. Some people have few, if any, recognized problems in the early stages of the disease, whereas others experience symptoms that may include: | Fatigue. | Belly discomfort. | Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, called jaundice. Depending on skin color, this change may be harder or easier to see. | An enlarged liver. | Irregular blood vessels on the skin, called spider angiomas. | Skin rash. | Joint pain. | Loss of menstrual periods.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autoimmune-hepatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352153
Toxic hepatitis,"Toxic hepatitis is an inflammation of your liver in reaction to certain substances to which you're exposed. Toxic hepatitis can be caused by alcohol, chemicals, drugs or nutritional supplements.
In some cases, toxic hepatitis develops within hours or days of exposure to a toxin. In other cases, it may take months of regular use before signs and symptoms appear.
The symptoms of toxic hepatitis often go away when exposure to the toxin stops. But toxic hepatitis can permanently damage your liver, leading to irreversible scarring of liver tissue (cirrhosis) and in some cases to liver failure, which can be life-threatening.","Mild forms of toxic hepatitis may not cause any symptoms and may be detected only by blood tests. When signs and symptoms of toxic hepatitis occur, they may include: | Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) | Itching | Abdominal pain in the upper right portion of the abdomen | Fatigue | Loss of appetite | Nausea and vomiting | Rash | Fever | Weight loss | Dark or tea-colored urine",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/toxic-hepatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352202
Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is a rare inherited condition that causes copper levels to build up in several organs, especially the liver, brain and eyes. Most people with Wilson's disease are diagnosed between the ages of 5 and 35. But younger and older people can be affected too.
Copper plays a key role in building healthy nerves, bones, collagen and the skin pigment melanin. You usually take in copper from the food you eat. Your liver produces a substance called bile that removes any extra copper.
But in people with Wilson's disease, copper isn't removed properly and instead builds up. Sometimes it can be life-threatening if it's not treated. When diagnosed early, Wilson's disease is treatable, and many people with the condition live normal lives.","Wilson's disease is present at birth, but symptoms don't appear until copper levels build up in the brain, liver, eyes or another organ. Symptoms vary based on the parts of your body the disease affects. | These symptoms can include: | Tiredness and loss of appetite. | A yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eye, known as jaundice. | Golden-brown or copper-colored rings around the irises of the eyes, known as Kayser-Fleischer rings. | Fluid buildup in the legs or stomach area. | Problems with speech, swallowing or physical coordination. | Depression, mood changes and personality changes. | Having a hard time falling asleep and staying asleep. | Uncontrolled movements or muscle stiffness.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/wilsons-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353251

Hepatopulmonary syndrome,"Hepatopulmonary (hep-uh-toe-POOL-moe-nar-e) syndrome is caused by blood vessels in the lungs expanding, also called dilating, and increasing in number. This condition affects the lungs of people who have advanced liver disease.
These changes in the lungs make it hard for red blood cells to take in oxygen. Then the lungs can't send enough oxygen to the body. This leads to low oxygen levels in the blood, also called hypoxemia.
How liver disease is linked to the lung condition isn't yet known. Aliver transplantis the only cure for hepatopulmonary syndrome.","Often, there are no symptoms of hepatopulmonary syndrome. If there are symptoms, they can include: | Shortness of breath that's worse when sitting or standing and gets better when lying down. | Clubbing of the fingers, in which the fingertips spread out and become rounder than usual. | Broken blood vessels under the skin, called spider angioma. | Bluish tinge of the lips and skin in white people.

This change in color is called cyanosis.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hepatopulmonary-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20373350
Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia,"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (tuh-lan-jee-uk-TAY-zhuh) is a condition that's passed through families, called inherited. It causes atypical links between arteries and veins called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The most common sites AVMs affect are the skin, nose, digestive system, lungs, brain and liver.
AVMs may get larger over time. They can bleed or burst. This can result in serious complications, including death.
Nosebleeds that happen for no known reason are the most common symptom. Nosebleeds can happen every day. Ongoing bleeding from the nose and the intestinal tract can result in serious iron deficiency anemia and poor quality of life.
Also called Osler-Weber-Rendu disease and HHT, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia passes from parents to children. How bad it is can vary greatly from person to person, even within the same family.
If you have HHT and have children, you may want to have them checked for the condition. HHT can affect them even if they don't have symptoms.","Symptoms of HHT include: | Nosebleeds. These can happen every day. They often start in childhood. | Lacy red vessels or tiny red spots, mostly on the lips, face, fingertips, tongue and inside the mouth. These are called telangiectasias. | Iron deficiency anemia due to bleeding from the nose or intestinal tract. | Shortness of breath. | Headaches. | Seizures. | Pus-filled swelling in the brain, called a brain abscess, and strokes. | Infection in a bone, called osteomyelitis.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hht/symptoms-causes/syc-20351135

Lynch syndrome,"Lynch syndrome is a condition that increases the risk of many kinds of cancer. This condition is passed from parents to children.
Families that have Lynch syndrome have more instances of cancer than expected. This might include colon cancer, endometrial cancer and other types of cancer. Lynch syndrome also causes cancers to happen at an earlier age.
People with Lynch syndrome may need careful testing to look for cancer when it's small. Treatment is more likely to be successful when the cancer is caught early. Some people with Lynch syndrome might consider treatments to prevent cancer.
Lynch syndrome used to be called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC).HNPCCis a term used to describe families with a strong history of colon cancer. Lynch syndrome is the term used when healthcare professionals find a gene that runs in the family and causes cancer.","People with Lynch syndrome may experience: | Colon cancer before age 50 | Cancer of the inside lining of the uterus (endometrial cancer) before age 50 | A personal history of more than one type of cancer | A family history of cancer before age 50 | A family history of other cancers caused by Lynch syndrome, including stomach cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, ureteral cancer, brain cancer, small bowel cancer, gallbladder cancer, bile duct cancer and skin cancer",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lynch-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20374714
Hiatal hernia,"A hiatal hernia happens when the upper part of the stomach bulges through the large muscle that separates the abdomen and the chest. The muscle is called the diaphragm.
The diaphragm has a small opening called a hiatus. The tube used for swallowing food, called the esophagus, passes through the hiatus before connecting to the stomach. In a hiatal hernia, the stomach pushes up through that opening and into the chest.
A small hiatal hernia usually doesn't cause problems. You may never know you have one unless your healthcare team discovers it when checking for another condition.
But a large hiatal hernia can allow food and acid to back up into your esophagus. This can cause heartburn. Self-care measures or medicines can usually relieve these symptoms. A very large hiatal hernia might need surgery.","Most small hiatal hernias cause no symptoms. But larger hiatal hernias can cause: | Heartburn. | Backward flow of swallowed food or liquids into the mouth, called regurgitation. | Backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus, called acid reflux. | Trouble swallowing. | Chest or abdominal pain. | Feeling full soon after you eat. | Shortness of breath. | Vomiting of blood or passing of black stools, which could mean bleeding in the digestive tract.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hiatal-hernia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373379

Herniated disk,"A herniated disk refers to a problem with one of the rubbery cushions, called disks, that sit between the bones that stack to make the spine. These bones are called vertebrae.
A spinal disk has a soft, jellylike center called a nucleus. The nucleus is encased in a tougher, rubbery exterior, known as the annulus. A herniated disk occurs when some of the nucleus pushes out through a tear in the annulus. A herniated disk is sometimes called a slipped disk or a ruptured disk.
A herniated disk, which can occur in any part of the spine, most often occurs in the lower back. Depending on where the herniated disk is, it can result in pain, numbness or weakness in an arm or a leg.
Many people have no symptoms from a herniated disk. For people who do have symptoms, the symptoms tend to improve over time. Surgery is usually not needed to relieve the problem.","Most herniated disks occur in the lower back, but they also can occur in the neck. Symptoms depend on where the disk is sitting and whether the disk is pressing on a nerve. Herniated disks often affect one side of the body. | Arm or leg pain.If your herniated disk is in your lower back, you'll typically feel pain in your lower back, buttocks, thigh and calf. You might have pain in part of your foot as well.For a herniated disk in your neck, you'll typically feel the most pain in your shoulder and arm. This pain might shoot into your arm or leg when you cough, sneeze or move into certain positions. Pain is often described as sharp or burning. | Numbness or tingling.People who have herniated disks often have radiating numbness or tingling in the body part served by the affected nerves. | Weakness.Muscles served by the affected nerves tend to weaken. This can cause you to stumble or affect your ability to lift or hold items. | You can have a herniated disk without symptoms.

Genital herpes,"Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI). The herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes genital herpes. Genital herpes can often be spread by skin-to-skin contact during sexual activity.
Some people infected with the virus may have very mild symptoms or no symptoms. They can still able to spread the virus. Other people have pain, itching and sores around the genitals, anus or mouth.
There is no cure for genital herpes. Symptoms often show up again after the first outbreak. Medicine can ease symptoms. It also lowers the risk of infecting others. Condoms can help prevent the spread of a genital herpes infection.","Most people infected withHSVdon't know they have it. They may have no symptoms or have very mild symptoms. | Symptoms start about 2 to 12 days after exposure to the virus. They may include: | Pain or itching around the genitals | Small bumps or blisters around the genitals, anus or mouth | Painful ulcers that form when blisters rupture and ooze or bleed | Scabs that form as the ulcers heal | Painful urination | Discharge from the urethra, the tube that releases urine from the body | Discharge from the vagina | During the first outbreak, you may commonly have flu-like symptoms such as: | Fever | Headache | Body aches | Swollen lymph nodes in the groin",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/genital-herpes/symptoms-causes/syc-20356161
Hiccups,"Hiccups are repeated spasms or sudden movements of the diaphragm that you can't control. The diaphragm is the muscle that separates your chest from your stomach area and plays an important role in breathing. A spasm in your diaphragm causes your vocal cords to suddenly close, producing a ""hic"" sound.
Eating a large meal, drinking alcoholic or carbonated beverages, or getting excited suddenly may cause hiccups. In some cases, hiccups may be a sign of an underlying medical issue. For most people, hiccups usually last only a few minutes. Rarely, hiccups may continue for months. When they last that long, they can result in weight loss and extreme tiredness.","Symptoms include uncontrolled spasms in your diaphragm and a ""hic"" sound. Sometimes you may feel a slight tightening sensation in your chest, stomach area or throat.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hiccups/symptoms-causes/syc-20352613
Hidradenitis suppurativa,"Hidradenitis suppurativa (hi-drad-uh-NIE-tis sup-yoo-ruh-TIE-vuh), also known as acne inversa, is a condition that causes small, painful lumps to form under the skin. The lumps usually develop in areas where your skin rubs together, such as the armpits, groin, buttocks and breasts. The lumps heal slowly, recur, and can lead to tunnels under the skin and scarring.
Hidradenitis suppurativa tends to start after puberty, usually before age 40. It can persist for many years and worsen over time. It can affect your daily life and emotional well-being. Combined medical and surgical therapy can help manage the disease and prevent complications.
Women are three times more likely to develop hidradenitis suppurativa, though this ratio can differ by location around the world. Also, Black people are more likely to develop this disease than people of other races. This could be attributed to genetic factors.","Hidradenitis suppurativa can affect one or several areas of the body. Signs and symptoms of the condition include: | Blackheads.Blackheads appear in small, pitted areas of skin, often appearing in pairs. | Painful pea-sized lumps.The condition usually starts with a single, painful lump under the skin that persists for weeks or months. More bumps may form later, usually in areas where you have more sweat and oil glands or where the skin rubs together, such as the armpits, groin, buttocks and breasts. | Leaking bumps or sores.Some bumps or sores get bigger, break open and drain pus with an odor. | Tunnels.Over time, tunnels might form under the skin, connecting the lumps. These wounds heal slowly, if at all, and drain blood and pus. | Some people with this condition experience only mild symptoms. The course of the disease is highly variable.

High cholesterol,"Cholesterol is a waxy substance found in the blood. The body needs cholesterol to build healthy cells. But high levels of cholesterol can raise the risk of heart disease.
With high cholesterol, fats and other substances can build up in blood vessels called arteries. This buildup is called plaque. As more plaque forms over time, the arteries can become narrowed or clogged. That makes it hard for enough blood to flow through the arteries. Sometimes a piece of plaque can break loose and form a blood clot. The clot may cause a heart attack or stroke.
High cholesterol can be inherited. That means it can pass from parents to children through genes. But high cholesterol often is the result of lifestyle choices such as not getting enough exercise, not eating a balanced diet or consuming large amounts of saturated fat. You can make changes to help prevent it. And if you have high cholesterol, you can help lower it with a healthy diet, regular exercise and sometimes medicine.",High cholesterol has no symptoms.

Hip dysplasia,"Hip dysplasia is the medical term for a hip socket that doesn't fully cover the ball portion of the upper thighbone. This allows the hip joint to become partially or completely dislocated. Most people with hip dysplasia are born with the condition.
Healthcare professionals will check your baby for signs of hip dysplasia shortly after birth and during well-baby visits. If hip dysplasia is diagnosed in early infancy, a soft brace can usually correct the problem.
Mild hip dysplasia might not start causing symptoms until a person is a teenager or young adult. Hip dysplasia can damage the cartilage lining the joint. It also can hurt the soft cartilage, called the labrum, that rims the socket portion of the hip joint. This is called a hip labral tear.
In older children and young adults, surgery may be needed to move the bones into the proper positions for smooth joint movement.","Symptoms vary by age group. In infants, you might notice that one leg is longer than the other. Once a child begins walking, a limp may develop. During diaper changes, one hip may be less flexible than the other. | In teenagers and young adults, hip dysplasia can cause painful complications such as osteoarthritis or a hip labral tear.

HIVis spread through contact with genitals, such as during sex without a condom. This type of infection is called a sexually transmitted infection, also called an STI.HIValso is spread through contact with blood, such as when people share needles or syringes. It is also possible for a person with untreatedHIVto spread the virus to a child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.

Angioedema can arise with hives or alone. It causes swelling in the deeper layers of skin, often around the face and lips. Short-lived (acute) hives and angioedema are common. Most times, they are harmless, clear up within in a day and don't leave any lasting marks, even without treatment. Hives that last longer than six weeks are called chronic hives.
Hives and angioedema are usually treated with antihistamine medication. Angioedema can be life-threatening if swelling of the tongue or in the throat blocks the airway.",,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hives-and-angioedema/symptoms-causes/syc-20354908

The welts often start as itchy patches that turn into swollen welts that vary in size. These welts appear and fade at random as the reaction runs its course. Each individual welt typically lasts less than 24 hours.
Chronic hives can be very uncomfortable and interfere with sleep and daily activities. For many people, anti-itch medicines, called antihistamines, provide relief.","Symptoms of chronic hives include: | Batches of welts, called weals, that can arise anywhere on the body. | Welts that might be red, purple or skin-colored, depending on your skin color. | Welts that vary in size, change shape, and appear and fade repeatedly. | Itchiness, also called pruritus, which can be intense. | Painful swelling, called angioedema, around the eyes, cheeks or lips. | Flares triggered by heat, exercise or stress. | Symptoms that persist for more than six weeks and recur often and anytime, sometimes for months or years.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-hives/symptoms-causes/syc-20352719
Hoarding disorder,"Hoarding disorder is an ongoing difficulty throwing away or parting with possessions because you believe that you need to save them. You may experience distress at the thought of getting rid of the items. You gradually keep or gather a huge number of items, regardless of their actual value.
Hoarding often creates extremely cramped living conditions with only narrow pathways winding through stacks of clutter. Countertops, sinks, stoves, desks, stairways and all other surfaces are usually piled with stuff. You may not be able to use some areas for their intended purpose. For example, you may not be able to cook in the kitchen. When there's no more room inside your home, the clutter may spread to the garage, vehicles, yard and other storage areas.
Hoarding ranges from mild to severe. In some cases, hoarding may not have much impact on your life, while in other cases it seriously affects your daily functioning.
People with hoarding disorder may not see it as a problem, so getting them to take part in treatment can be challenging. But intensive treatment can help you understand how your beliefs and behaviors can be changed so that you can live a safer, more enjoyable life.","The first symptoms of hoarding disorder often appear during the teenage to early adult years. You may get and save too many items, gradually build up clutter in living spaces, and have difficulty getting rid of things. | As you grow older, you may continue getting and holding onto things that you may never use and don't have space for. By middle age, the clutter can become overwhelming as symptoms become more severe and increasingly difficult to treat. | Problems with hoarding gradually develop over time and tend to be a private behavior. You may avoid having family, friends or repair workers in your home. Often, major clutter has developed by the time it reaches the attention of others. | Symptoms of hoarding disorder may include: | Getting and keeping too many items that you may not have a need for right now and don't have space for. | Ongoing difficulty throwing out or parting with your things, regardless of their actual value. | Feeling a need to save these items and being upset by the thought of getting rid of them. | Building up clutter to the point where you can't use rooms. | Trying to be perfect and avoiding or delaying decisions. | Problems with planning and organizing. | Getting too many items and refusing to part with them results in: | Disorganized piles or stacks of items, such as newspapers, clothes, paperwork, books or sentimental items. | Items that crowd and clutter your walking spaces and living areas. Rooms can't be used for the intended purpose, such as not being able to sleep in your bed. | Buildup of food or trash to large, unsanitary levels. | Distress or problems functioning or keeping yourself, others and pets safe in your home. | Conflict with others who try to reduce or remove clutter from your home. | Relationship issues, avoiding social activities and employment problems. | Difficulty organizing items and sometimes losing important items in the clutter. | With hoarding disorder, items are usually saved because: | You believe these items are unique or that you'll need them at some point in the future. | You feel emotionally connected to items that remind you of happier times or represent beloved people or pets. | You feel safe and comforted when surrounded by things. | You don't want to waste anything. | Hoarding disorder is different from collecting. People who have collections, such as stamps or model cars, carefully search out specific items, organize them and display their collections. Collections can be large, but they aren't usually cluttered. Also, they don't cause the distress and problems functioning that are part of hoarding disorder.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hoarding-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20356056

Hodgkin lymphoma (Hodgkin disease),"Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is part of the body's germ-fighting and disease-fighting immune system. Hodgkin lymphoma begins when healthy cells in the lymphatic system change and grow out of control.
The lymphatic system includes lymph nodes. They are found throughout the body. Most lymph nodes are in the abdomen, groin, pelvis, chest, underarms and neck.
The lymphatic system also includes the spleen, thymus, tonsils and bone marrow. Hodgkin lymphoma can affect all these areas and other organs in the body.
Hodgkin lymphoma, which used to be called Hodgkin disease, is one of two broad types of lymphoma. The other is non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Advances in diagnosis and treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma have helped give people with this disease the chance for a full recovery.","Signs and symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma may include: | Painless swelling of lymph nodes in the neck, armpits or groin. | Fever. | Feeling very tired. | Night sweats. | Weight loss that happens without trying. | Itchy skin.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hodgkins-lymphoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352646

Kyphosis,"Kyphosis is an excessive forward rounding of the upper back.
In older people, kyphosis is often due to weakness in the spinal bones that causes them to compress or crack. Other types of kyphosis can appear in infants or teens. These types are due to malformation of the spine or wedging of the spinal bones over time.
Mild kyphosis causes few problems. Serious kyphosis can cause pain and be disfiguring. Treatment for kyphosis depends on your age, and the cause and seriousness of the curvature.","Mild kyphosis may not have any noticeable symptoms. In fact, the upper back naturally has a little kyphosis. People who have excessive curvature may experience back pain and stiffness.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kyphosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20374205
Huntington's disease,"Huntington's disease causes nerve cells in the brain to decay over time. The disease affects a person's movements, thinking ability and mental health.
Huntington's disease is rare. It's often passed down through a changed gene from a parent.
Huntington's disease symptoms can develop at any time, but they often begin when people are in their 30s or 40s. If the disease develops before age 20, it's called juvenile Huntington's disease. When Huntington's develops early, symptoms can be different and the disease may have a faster progression.
Medicines are available to help manage the symptoms of Huntington's disease. However, treatments can't prevent the physical, mental and behavioral decline caused by the disease.",Huntington's disease usually causes movement disorders. It also causes mental health conditions and trouble with thinking and planning. These conditions can cause a wide spectrum of symptoms. The first symptoms vary greatly from person to person. Some symptoms appear to be worse or have a greater effect on functional ability. These symptoms may change in severity throughout the course of the disease.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/huntingtons-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356117

Progeria,"Progeria (pro-JEER-e-uh), also known as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, is an extremely rare, progressive genetic disorder. It causes children to age rapidly, starting in their first two years of life.
Children with progeria generally appear healthy at birth. During the first year, symptoms such as slowed growth, loss of fat tissue and hair loss begin to appear.
Heart problems or strokes are the eventual cause of death in most children with progeria. The average life expectancy for a child with progeria is about 15 years. Some with the condition may die younger and others may live longer, even to about 20 years.
There's no cure for progeria, but new treatments and research show some promise for managing symptoms and complications.","Usually within the first year of life, you'll notice that your child's growth has slowed. But motor development and intelligence are not affected. | Symptoms of this progressive disorder cause a distinctive appearance. They include: | Slowed growth and poor weight gain, with below-average height and weight. | Lack of fat that's stored just beneath the skin. | Head that is large compared with the face. | Small jaw, chin and mouth and thin lips. | Thin, curved nose with a slight hook at the end, which may look like a bird's beak. | Large eyes and eyelids that don't close completely. | Hair loss, including eyelashes and eyebrows. | Thin, spotty and wrinkled skin. | Veins easily seen through the skin. | High-pitched voice. | Premature aging. | Symptoms also include health issues: | Severe progressive heart and blood vessel disease, also known as cardiovascular disease. | Hardening and tightening of skin. | Delayed tooth formation and tooth shape that is not usual. | Some hearing loss. | Loss of fat under the skin and loss of muscle. | Problems with the growth and development of bones. | Joint problems, including stiff joints. | A hip that's forced out of the correct position, known as hip dislocation. | Dental problems. | No significant progression of puberty. | Insulin resistance, which means the body doesn't respond well to insulin made by an organ called the pancreas.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/progeria/symptoms-causes/syc-20356038
Hydrocele,"A hydrocele (HI-droe-seel) is a type of swelling in the scrotum, the pouch of skin that holds the testicles. This swelling happens when fluid collects in the thin sac that surrounds a testicle. Hydroceles are common in newborns. They often go away without treatment by age 1. Older children and adults can get a hydrocele due to an injury within the scrotum or other health problems.
A hydrocele often isn't painful or harmful. It might not need any treatment. But it's important to see a health care provider if the scrotum looks swollen.","Often the only sign of a hydrocele is a painless swelling of one or both testicles. | The swelling might make an adult's scrotum feel heavy. In general, pain gets worse as the swelling increases. Sometimes, the swollen area might be smaller in the morning and larger later in the day.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hydrocele/symptoms-causes/syc-20363969
Hydrocephalus,"Hydrocephalus is the buildup of fluid in cavities called ventricles deep within the brain. The excess fluid increases the size of the ventricles and puts pressure on the brain.
Cerebrospinal fluid usually flows through the ventricles and bathes the brain and spinal column. But the pressure of too much cerebrospinal fluid can damage brain tissues and cause a range of symptoms related to brain function.
Hydrocephalus can happen at any age, but it occurs more often among infants and among adults 60 and older. Surgery can restore and maintain healthy cerebrospinal fluid levels in the brain. Therapies can manage symptoms resulting from hydrocephalus.",The symptoms of hydrocephalus can vary by age.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hydrocephalus/symptoms-causes/syc-20373604
Hydronephrosis,"Hydronephrosis is swelling of one or both kidneys. It happens when urine can't drain from a kidney and builds up in the kidney as a result. The condition can be due to a blockage in the tubes that drain urine from the kidneys. It also can happen due to a difference present at birth that prevents urine from draining properly. In some people, hydronephrosis causes kidney damage over time.
Hydronephrosis can happen at any age. The condition often causes no symptoms. People who get symptoms may have side and back pain, painful urination, vomiting and fever. Healthcare professionals have various ways to spot hydronephrosis. Tests to find the condition can be done during infancy or sometimes before a baby is born.
Treatment for hydronephrosis depends on the condition's cause. Some people need medicine or surgery to feel better and prevent kidney damage. Mild hydronephrosis sometimes goes away on its own over time.","Hydronephrosis often causes no symptoms. But when symptoms happen, they can include: | Pain in the side and back that may travel to the lower stomach area or groin. | Pain with urination, or feeling a need to urinate that is urgent or happens often. | Upset stomach and vomiting. | Fever. | Failure to thrive in infants. | Weight loss or loss of appetite. | Blood in urine.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hydronephrosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20575276
Hypercalcemia,"Hypercalcemia is a condition in which the calcium level in the blood becomes too high. Too much calcium in the blood can weaken bones and create kidney stones. It also can affect the heart and brain.
Most often, hypercalcemia happens after one or more of the parathyroid glands make too much hormone. These four tiny glands are in the neck, near the thyroid gland. Other causes of hypercalcemia include cancer, certain other medical conditions and some medicines. Taking too much of calcium and vitamin D supplements also can cause hypercalcemia.
Some people have no symptoms of this condition. Others have symptoms that range from mild to serious. Treatment depends on the cause.","You might not have any symptoms if your hypercalcemia is mild. If it's more serious, your symptoms are related to the parts of your body affected by high blood calcium levels. Examples include: | Kidneys.Excess calcium makes the kidneys work harder to filter it. This can cause serious thirst and frequent urination. | Digestive system.Hypercalcemia can cause stomach upset or pain, vomiting, and constipation. | Bones and muscles.Most often, the extra calcium in the blood is leached from the bones. This weakens the bones. It can cause bone pain and muscle weakness. | Brain.Hypercalcemia can affect how the brain works. That can lead to trouble focusing, confusion, drowsiness and fatigue. It also can cause depression. | Heart.Rarely, serious hypercalcemia can affect the heart. It can cause feelings of a fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart. It also can cause the heart to beat out of rhythm. It's linked with other heart-related conditions as well.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypercalcemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355523

Cushing syndrome,"Cushing syndrome happens when the body has too much of the hormone cortisol for a long time. This can result from the body making too much cortisol, or from taking medicines called glucocorticoids, which affect the body the same way as cortisol.
Too much cortisol can cause some of the main symptoms of Cushing syndrome — a fatty hump between the shoulders, a rounded face, and pink or purple stretch marks on the skin. Cushing syndrome also can cause high blood pressure or bone loss. Sometimes, it can cause type 2 diabetes.
Treatments for Cushing syndrome can lower the body's cortisol levels and improve symptoms. The sooner treatment starts, the better the chances for recovery.",Symptoms of Cushing syndrome can vary depending on the level of extra cortisol.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cushing-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20351310

Hyperhidrosis,"Hyperhidrosis (hi-pur-hi-DROE-sis) is excessive sweating that's not always related to heat or exercise. You may sweat so much that it soaks through your clothes or drips off your hands. Heavy sweating can disrupt your day and cause social anxiety and embarrassment.
Hyperhidrosis treatment usually helps. It often begins with antiperspirants. If these don't help, you may need to try different medications and therapies. In severe cases, your health care provider may suggest surgery to remove the sweat glands or to disconnect the nerves related to producing too much sweat.
Sometimes an underlying condition may be found and treated.","The main symptom of hyperhidrosis is heavy sweating. This goes beyond the sweating from being in a hot environment, exercising, or feeling anxious or stressed. The type of hyperhidrosis that usually affects the hands, feet, underarms or face causes at least one episode a week when you're awake. And the sweating usually happens on both sides of the body.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hyperhidrosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20367152
Farsightedness,"Farsightedness (hyperopia) is a common vision condition in which you can see distant objects clearly, but objects nearby may be blurry.
The degree of your farsightedness influences your focusing ability. People with severe farsightedness may be able to clearly see only objects a great distance away, while those with mild farsightedness may be able to clearly see objects that are closer.
Farsightedness usually is present at birth and tends to run in families. You can easily correct this condition with eyeglasses or contact lenses. Another treatment option is surgery.","Farsightedness may mean: | Nearby objects may appear blurry | You need to squint to see clearly | You have eyestrain, including burning eyes, and aching in or around the eyes | You have general eye discomfort or a headache after doing close tasks, such as reading, writing, computer work or drawing, for a time",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/farsightedness/symptoms-causes/syc-20372495
Hyperoxaluria and oxalosis,"Hyperoxaluria (hi-pur-ok-suh-LU-ree-uh) happens when you have too much oxalate in your urine. Oxalate is a natural chemical the body makes. It's also found in some foods. But too much oxalate in the urine can cause serious problems.
Hyperoxaluria can be caused by a change in a gene, an intestine disease or eating too many foods that are high in oxalate. The long-term health of your kidneys depends on finding hyperoxaluria early and getting it treated quickly.
Oxalosis (ok-suh-LOW-sis) happens after the kidneys stop working well in people who have primary and intestine-related causes of hyperoxaluria. Too much oxalate collects in the blood. This can lead to oxalate buildups in blood vessels, bones and organs.","Often, the first sign of hyperoxaluria is a kidney stone. Kidney stone symptoms can include: | Sharp pain in the back, side, lower stomach area or groin. | Urine that looks pink, red or brown due to blood. | Frequent urge to pee, also called urination. | Pain when peeing. | Not being able to urinate or peeing only a small amount. | Chills, fever, upset stomach or vomiting.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hyperoxaluria/symptoms-causes/syc-20352254

Compulsive sexual behavior,"Compulsive sexual behavior is sometimes called hypersexuality or sexual addiction. It's an intense focus on sexual fantasies, urges or behaviors that can't be controlled. This causes distress and problems for your health, job, relationships or other parts of your life.
Compulsive sexual behavior may involve different kinds of commonly enjoyable sexual experiences. Examples include masturbation, sexual arousal by using a computer to communicate, multiple sexual partners, use of pornography or paying for sex. But when these sexual behaviors become a major, constant focus in your life, are difficult to control, cause problems in your life, or are harmful to you or others, that's likely compulsive sexual behavior.
No matter what it's called or the exact nature of the behavior, untreated compulsive sexual behavior can damage your self-esteem, relationships, career, health and other people. But with treatment and self-help, you can learn to manage compulsive sexual behavior.","Some signs that you may have compulsive sexual behavior include: | You have repeated and intense sexual fantasies, urges, and behaviors that take up a lot of your time and feel as if they're beyond your control. | You feel driven or have frequent urges to do certain sexual behaviors, feel a release of the tension afterward, but also feel guilt or deep regret. | You've tried without success to reduce or control your sexual fantasies, urges or behavior. | You use compulsive sexual behavior as an escape from other problems, such as loneliness, depression, anxiety or stress. | You continue to engage in sexual behaviors in spite of them causing serious problems. These could include the possibility of getting or giving someone else a sexually transmitted infection, the loss of important relationships, trouble at work, financial issues, or legal problems. | You have trouble making and keeping healthy and stable relationships.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/compulsive-sexual-behavior/symptoms-causes/syc-20360434

Pulmonary hypertension,"Pulmonary hypertension is a type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in the lungs and the right side of the heart.
In one form of pulmonary hypertension, called pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), blood vessels in the lungs are narrowed, blocked or destroyed. The damage slows blood flow through the lungs. Blood pressure in the lung arteries goes up. The heart must work harder to pump blood through the lungs. The extra effort eventually causes the heart muscle to become weak and fail.
In some people, pulmonary hypertension slowly gets worse and can be life-threatening. There's no cure for pulmonary hypertension. But treatments are available to help you feel better, live longer and improve your quality of life.","The symptoms of pulmonary hypertension develop slowly. You may not notice them for months or even years. Symptoms get worse as the disease progresses. | Pulmonary hypertension symptoms include: | Shortness of breath, at first while exercising and eventually while at rest. | Blue or gray skin color due to low oxygen levels. Depending on your skin color, these changes may be harder or easier to see. | Chest pressure or pain. | Dizziness or fainting spells. | Fast pulse or pounding heartbeat. | Fatigue. | Swelling in the ankles, legs and belly area. | Shortness of breath is the most common symptom of pulmonary hypertension. But it may be caused by other health conditions such as asthma. See a health care professional for an accurate diagnosis.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pulmonary-hypertension/symptoms-causes/syc-20350697
Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid),"Hyperthyroidism happens when the thyroid gland makes too much thyroid hormone. This condition also is called overactive thyroid. Hyperthyroidism speeds up the body's metabolism. That can cause many symptoms, such as weight loss, hand tremors, and rapid or irregular heartbeat.
Several treatments are available for hyperthyroidism. Anti-thyroid medicines and radioiodine can be used to slow the amount of hormones the thyroid gland makes. Sometimes, hyperthyroidism treatment includes surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid gland. In some cases, depending on what's causing it, hyperthyroidism may improve without medication or other treatment.","Hyperthyroidism sometimes looks like other health problems. That can make it hard to diagnose. It can cause many symptoms, including: | Losing weight without trying. | Fast heartbeat, a condition called tachycardia. | Irregular heartbeat, also called arrhythmia. | Pounding of the heart, sometimes called heart palpitations. | Increased hunger. | Nervousness, anxiety and irritability. | Tremor, usually a small trembling in the hands and fingers. | Sweating. | Changes in menstrual cycles. | Increased sensitivity to heat. | Changes in bowel patterns, especially more-frequent bowel movements. | Enlarged thyroid gland, sometimes called a goiter, which may appear as a swelling at the base of the neck. | Tiredness. | Muscle weakness. | Sleep problems. | Warm, moist skin. | Thinning skin. | Fine, brittle hair. | Older adults are more likely to have symptoms that are hard to notice. These symptoms may include an irregular heartbeat, weight loss, depression, and feeling weak or tired during ordinary activities.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hyperthyroidism/symptoms-causes/syc-20373659
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a disease in which the heart muscle becomes thickened, also called hypertrophied. The thickened heart muscle can make it harder for the heart to pump blood.
Many people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy don't realize they have it. That's because they have few, if any, symptoms. But in a small number of people withHCM, the thickened heart muscle can cause serious symptoms. These include shortness of breath and chest pain. Some people withHCMhave changes in the heart's electrical system. These changes can result in life-threatening irregular heartbeats or sudden death.","Symptoms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can include one or more of the following: | Chest pain, especially during exercise. | Fainting, especially during or just after exercise or other physical activity. | Sensation of fast, fluttering or pounding heartbeats called palpitations. | Shortness of breath, especially during exercise.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350198
Low sex drive in women,"Women's levels of sexual desire change over the years. It's common for highs and lows to happen along with the start or end of a relationship. Or they can happen with major life changes such as pregnancy, menopause or illness. Some medicines used for conditions that affect mood also can cause low sex drive in women.
If your lack of interest in sex continues or returns and causes personal distress, talk with your healthcare professional. You may have a treatable condition called sexual interest-arousal disorder.
But you don't have to meet this medical definition to seek help. If you're bothered by a low or reduced sex drive, you can take steps to boost your libido. Lifestyle changes and sexual techniques may put you in the mood more often. Some medicines may offer promise as well.","neither of you may have a sex drive that's outside what's typical for people at your stage in life. | And even if your sex drive is lower than it once was, your relationship may be strong. Bottom line: There is no magic number to define low sex drive. It varies. | Symptoms of low sex drive in women include: | Having less or no interest in any type of sexual activity, including masturbation. | Never or only seldom having sexual fantasies or thoughts. | Being sad or concerned about your lack of sexual activity or fantasies.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/low-sex-drive-in-women/symptoms-causes/syc-20374554
Hypoglycemia,"Hypoglycemia is a condition in which your blood sugar (glucose) level is lower than the standard range. Glucose is your body's main energy source.
Hypoglycemia is often related to diabetes treatment. But other drugs and a variety of conditions — many rare — can cause low blood sugar in people who don't have diabetes.
Hypoglycemia needs immediate treatment. For many people, a fasting blood sugar of 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 3.9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L), or below should serve as an alert for hypoglycemia. But your numbers might be different. Ask your health care provider.
Treatment involves quickly getting your blood sugar back to within the standard range either with a high-sugar food or drink or with medication. Long-term treatment requires identifying and treating the cause of hypoglycemia.","If blood sugar levels become too low, hypoglycemia signs and symptoms can include: | Looking pale | Shakiness | Sweating | Headache | Hunger or nausea | An irregular or fast heartbeat | Fatigue | Irritability or anxiety | Difficulty concentrating | Dizziness or lightheadedness | Tingling or numbness of the lips, tongue or cheek | As hypoglycemia worsens, signs and symptoms can include: | Confusion, unusual behavior or both, such as the inability to complete routine tasks | Loss of coordination | Slurred speech | Blurry vision or tunnel vision | Nightmares, if asleep | Severe hypoglycemia may cause: | Unresponsiveness (loss of consciousness) | Seizures",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypoglycemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373685

Dehydration,,,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dehydration/symptoms-causes/syc-20354086
Hyponatremia,"Hyponatremia occurs when the concentration of sodium in your blood is abnormally low. Sodium is an electrolyte, and it helps regulate the amount of water that's in and around your cells.
In hyponatremia, one or more factors — ranging from an underlying medical condition to drinking too much water — cause the sodium in your body to become diluted. When this happens, your body's water levels rise, and your cells begin to swell. This swelling can cause many health problems, from mild to life-threatening.
Hyponatremia treatment is aimed at resolving the underlying condition. Depending on the cause of hyponatremia, you may simply need to cut back on how much you drink. In other cases of hyponatremia, you may need intravenous electrolyte solutions and medications.","Hyponatremia signs and symptoms may include: | Nausea and vomiting | Headache | Confusion | Loss of energy, drowsiness and fatigue | Restlessness and irritability | Muscle weakness, spasms or cramps | Seizures | Coma",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hyponatremia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373711

Hypopituitarism,"Hypopituitarism is a rare condition in which the pituitary gland doesn't make one or more hormones or doesn't make enough hormones.
The pituitary gland is a kidney-bean-sized gland at the base of your brain. It is part of the body's system of glands that make hormones, called the endocrine system. The pituitary gland makes several hormones. They act on nearly every part of the body.
Hypopituitarism is when there isn't enough of one or more of the pituitary hormones. This lack of hormones, called a deficiency, can affect how the body works in many ways. These include growth, blood pressure and the ability to have children, among others. Symptoms depend on which hormones are missing.
People who have hypopituitarism usually need to take medicines for the rest of their lives. These medicines replace the missing hormones, which helps control symptoms.","The symptoms of hypopituitarism usually start slowly and get worse over time. They might not be noticed for months or even years. But for some people, symptoms start suddenly. | Symptoms of hypopituitarism vary from person to person. Symptoms depend on what hormones are missing and how little of the hormone is being made. There might be more than one hormone that's low. A second hormone deficiency might increase the symptoms of the first one. Or sometimes, it might hide those symptoms.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypopituitarism/symptoms-causes/syc-20351645
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome,"Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a rare heart condition that a child is born with. That means it's a congenital heart defect. In this condition, the left side of the heart doesn't develop fully and is too small. So it can't pump blood well. Instead, the right side of the heart must pump blood to the lungs and to the rest of the body.
Treatment for hypoplastic left heart syndrome may include medicines, heart surgery or a heart transplant. Advances in care have improved the outlook for babies born with HLHS.","Babies born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) usually are very sick soon after birth. Symptoms of HLHS include: | Blue or gray skin, lips or fingernails. Depending on skin color, these changes may be harder or easier to see. | Rapid, difficult breathing. | Poor feeding. | Cold hands and feet. | Weak pulse. | Being more drowsy or less active than is typical for most babies. | Without treatment, a baby with this condition may go into shock. Symptoms of shock include: | Cool, clammy skin that can be pale or lips that can be blue or gray. | A weak and rapid pulse. | Breathing that may be slow and shallow or very rapid. | Dull eyes that seem to stare.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20350599
Low blood pressure (hypotension),"Low blood pressure is a condition in which the force of the blood pushing against the artery walls is too low. It's also called hypotension.
Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). In general, low blood pressure is a reading lower than 90/60 mm Hg.
What's considered low blood pressure for one person might be OK for someone else though. Low blood pressure might cause no symptoms that you notice. Or it might cause dizziness and fainting. Sometimes, low blood pressure can be life-threatening.
The causes of low blood pressure include dehydration and other serious medical conditions. It's important to find out what's causing low blood pressure so that it can be treated, if needed.","Low blood pressure symptoms can include: | Blurred or fading vision. | Dizzy or lightheaded feelings. | Fainting. | Fatigue. | Trouble concentrating. | Upset stomach. | For some people, low blood pressure may be a symptom of an underlying health condition. That's especially so when blood pressure drops suddenly or when low blood pressure occurs with symptoms. | A sudden fall in blood pressure can be dangerous. A change of just 20 mm Hg can make you feel dizzy or faint. For example, those symptoms could happen after a drop in systolic pressure from 110 mm Hg to 90 mm Hg. And big drops can be life-threatening. These can happen for reasons such as serious bleeding, serious infections or allergic reactions. | Extreme low blood pressure can lead to a condition known as shock. Symptoms of shock include: | Confusion, especially in older people. | Cold, clammy skin. | Decrease in skin color, also called pallor. | Rapid, shallow breathing. | Weak and rapid pulse.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/low-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20355465
Hypothermia,"Hypothermia is a condition that occurs when core body temperature drops below 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius). It is a medical emergency. In hypothermia (hi-poe-THUR-me-uh), the body loses heat faster than it can produce heat, causing a dangerously low body temperature. Regular body temperature is around 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius).
When body temperature drops, the heart, nervous system and other organs can't work as well as they usually do. Left untreated, hypothermia can cause the heart and respiratory system to fail and eventually can lead to death.
Common causes of hypothermia include exposure to cold weather or immersion in cold water. Treatment for hypothermia includes methods to warm the body back to a regular temperature.","When the temperature starts to drop, the body can start to shiver. Shivering is the body's attempt to warm itself. It is an automatic defense against cold temperature. | Symptoms of hypothermia include: | Shivering. | Slurred speech or mumbling. | Slow, shallow breathing. | Weak pulse. | Clumsiness or lack of coordination. | Drowsiness or very low energy. | Confusion or memory loss. | Loss of consciousness. | In infants, bright red, cold skin. | People with hypothermia usually aren't aware of their condition. The symptoms often begin gradually. Also, the confused thinking associated with hypothermia prevents self-awareness. The confused thinking also can lead to risk-taking behavior.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypothermia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352682
Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid),"Hypothyroidism happens when the thyroid gland doesn't make enough thyroid hormone. This condition also is called underactive thyroid. Hypothyroidism may not cause noticeable symptoms in its early stages. Over time, hypothyroidism that isn't treated can lead to other health problems, such as high cholesterol and heart problems.
Blood tests are used to diagnose hypothyroidism. Treatment with thyroid hormone medicine usually is simple, safe and effective once you and your health care provider find the right dosage for you.","The symptoms of hypothyroidism depend on the severity of the condition. Problems tend to develop slowly, often over several years. | At first, you may barely notice the symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue and weight gain. Or you may think they are just part of getting older. But as your metabolism continues to slow, you may develop more-obvious problems. | Hypothyroidism symptoms may include: | Tiredness. | More sensitivity to cold. | Constipation. | Dry skin. | Weight gain. | Puffy face. | Hoarse voice. | Coarse hair and skin. | Muscle weakness. | Muscle aches, tenderness and stiffness. | Menstrual cycles that are heavier than usual or irregular. | Thinning hair. | Slowed heart rate, also called bradycardia. | Depression. | Memory problems.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypothyroidism/symptoms-causes/syc-20350284
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),"Inflammatory bowel disease, also called IBD, is an umbrella term for a group of conditions that cause swelling and inflammation of the tissues in the digestive tract.
The most common types ofIBDinclude:
Symptoms of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease usually include belly pain, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, extreme tiredness and weight loss.
For some people,IBDis only a mild illness. But for others, it's a condition that causes disability and can lead to life-threatening complications.",Inflammatory bowel disease symptoms vary depending on how bad the inflammation is and where it occurs. Symptoms may range from mild to severe. A person withIBDis likely to have periods of active illness followed by periods of remission. | Symptoms that are common to both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis include: | Diarrhea. | Belly pain and cramping. | Blood in the stool. | Loss of appetite. | Losing weight without trying. | Feeling extremely tired.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353315
Irritable bowel syndrome,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common condition that affects the stomach and intestines, also called the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms include cramping, belly pain, bloating, gas, and diarrhea or constipation, or both.IBSis an ongoing condition that needs long-term management.
Only a small number of people withIBShave severe symptoms. Some people can control their symptoms by managing diet, lifestyle and stress. More-severe symptoms can be treated with medicine and counseling.
IBSdoesn't cause changes in bowel tissue or increase risk of colorectal cancer.","Symptoms ofIBSvary but are usually present for a long time. The most common include: | Belly pain, cramping or bloating that is related to passing stool. | Changes in appearance of stool. | Changes in how often you are passing stool. | Other symptoms that are often related include sensation of incomplete evacuation and increased gas or mucus in the stool.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/irritable-bowel-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20360016

Myelofibrosis,"Myelofibrosis is an uncommon type of bone marrow cancer that disrupts your body's normal production of blood cells.
Myelofibrosis causes extensive scarring in your bone marrow, leading to severe anemia that can cause weakness and fatigue. Bone marrow scarring can also cause you to have a low number of blood-clotting cells called platelets, which increases the risk of bleeding. Myelofibrosis often causes an enlarged spleen.
Myelofibrosis is considered to be a chronic leukemia — a cancer that affects the blood-forming tissues in the body. Myelofibrosis belongs to a group of diseases called myeloproliferative disorders.
Myelofibrosis can happen on its own (primary myelofibrosis) or it can develop from another bone marrow disorder (secondary myelofibrosis).
Some people with myelofibrosis have no symptoms and might not need treatment right away. Others with more-serious forms of the disease might need aggressive treatments right away. Treatment for myelofibrosis, which focuses on relieving symptoms, can involve a variety of options.","Myelofibrosis usually develops slowly. In its very early stages, many people don't experience signs or symptoms. | As disruption of normal blood cell production increases, signs and symptoms may include: | Feeling tired, weak or short of breath, usually because of anemia | Pain or fullness below your ribs on the left side, due to an enlarged spleen | Easy bruising | Easy bleeding | Excessive sweating during sleep (night sweats) | Fever | Bone pain",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myelofibrosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355057
Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP),"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an illness that can lead to bruising and bleeding. Low levels of the cells that help blood clot, also known as platelets, most often cause the bleeding.
Once known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,ITPcan cause purple bruises. It also can cause tiny reddish-purple dots on the skin that look like a rash.
Children can getITPafter a virus. They most often get better without treatment. In adults, the illness often lasts months or years.
People withITPwho aren't bleeding and whose platelet count isn't too low might not need treatment. For worse symptoms, treatment might include medicines to raise platelet count or surgery to remove the spleen.","Immune thrombocytopenia might not have symptoms. When symptoms occur, they might include: | Easy bruising. | Bleeding into the skin that looks like tiny reddish-purple spots, also known as petechiae. The spots mostly show up on the lower legs. They look like a rash. | Bleeding into the skin that's larger than petechiae, also known as purpura. | Bleeding from the gums or nose. | Blood in urine or stools. | Really heavy menstrual flow.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/idiopathic-thrombocytopenic-purpura/symptoms-causes/syc-20352325

IgA nephropathy (Berger disease),"IgAnephropathy (nuh-FROP-uh-thee), also known as Berger disease, is a kidney disease. It happens when a germ-fighting protein called immunoglobulin A (IgA) builds up in the kidneys. This causes a type of swelling called inflammation that, over time, can make it harder for the kidneys to filter waste from the blood.
IgAnephropathy often becomes worse slowly over years. But the course of the disease varies from person to person. Some people leak blood into their urine without having other problems. Others might have complications such as losing kidney function and spilling protein into the urine. Still others develop kidney failure, which means the kidneys stop working well enough to filter the body's waste on their own.
There's no cure forIgAnephropathy, but medicines can slow how quickly it becomes worse. Some people need treatment to lower inflammation, reduce the spilling of protein into the urine and prevent the kidneys from failing. Such treatments may help the disease become not active, a state called remission. Keeping blood pressure under control and lowering cholesterol also slow the disease.","IgAnephropathy often doesn't cause symptoms early on. You might not notice any health effects for 10 years or more. Sometimes, routine medical tests find signs of the disease, such as protein and red blood cells in the urine that are seen under a microscope. | WhenIgAnephropathy causes symptoms, they might include: | Cola- or tea-colored urine caused by blood. You might notice these color changes after a cold, sore throat or respiratory infection. | Blood that can be seen in the urine. | Foamy urine from protein leaking into the urine. This is called proteinuria. | Pain on one or both sides of the back below the ribs. | Swelling in the hands and feet called edema. | High blood pressure. | Weakness and tiredness. | If the disease leads to kidney failure, symptoms may include: | Rashes and itchy skin. | Muscle cramps. | Upset stomach and vomiting. | Less appetite. | Metallic taste in the mouth. | Confusion. | Kidney failure is life-threatening without treatment. But dialysis or a kidney transplant can help people live for many more years.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/iga-nephropathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20352268

Illness anxiety disorder,"Illness anxiety disorder, sometimes called hypochondriasis or health anxiety, is worrying excessively that you are or may become seriously ill. You may have no physical symptoms. Or you may believe that normal body sensations or minor symptoms are signs of severe illness, even though a thorough medical exam doesn't reveal a serious medical condition.
You may experience extreme anxiety that body sensations, such as muscle twitching or fatigue, are associated with a specific, serious illness. This excessive anxiety — rather than the physical symptom itself — results in severe distress that can disrupt your life.
Illness anxiety disorder is a long-term condition that can fluctuate in severity. It may increase with age or during times of stress. But psychological counseling (psychotherapy) and sometimes medication can help ease your worries.","Symptoms of illness anxiety disorder involve preoccupation with the idea that you're seriously ill, based on normal body sensations (such as a noisy stomach) or minor signs (such as a minor rash). Signs and symptoms may include: | Being preoccupied with having or getting a serious disease or health condition | Worrying that minor symptoms or body sensations mean you have a serious illness | Being easily alarmed about your health status | Finding little or no reassurance from doctor visits or negative test results | Worrying excessively about a specific medical condition or your risk of developing a medical condition because it runs in your family | Having so much distress about possible illnesses that it's hard for you to function | Repeatedly checking your body for signs of illness or disease | Frequently making medical appointments for reassurance — or avoiding medical care for fear of being diagnosed with a serious illness | Avoiding people, places or activities for fear of health risks | Constantly talking about your health and possible illnesses | Frequently searching the internet for causes of symptoms or possible illnesses",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/illness-anxiety-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20373782
Impacted wisdom teeth,"Wisdom teeth, the third molars at the back of the mouth, are the last adult teeth to come in. Most people have four wisdom teeth — two on the top and two on the bottom. When wisdom teeth become impacted, they don't have enough room to emerge or develop in the usual way.
Impacted wisdom teeth can cause pain, damage other teeth and lead to other dental problems. Sometimes they don't cause any problems. But because wisdom teeth are hard to clean, they may be more prone to tooth decay and gum disease than other teeth.
Impacted wisdom teeth that cause pain or other dental problems usually are taken out. Some dentists and oral surgeons also recommend taking out impacted wisdom teeth that don't cause symptoms to prevent future problems.","Impacted wisdom teeth don't always cause symptoms. But when an impacted wisdom tooth becomes infected, damages other teeth or causes other dental problems, you may have some of these symptoms: | Red or swollen gums. | Tender or bleeding gums. | Jaw pain. | Swelling around the jaw. | Bad breath. | An unpleasant taste in your mouth. | A hard time opening your mouth.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/wisdom-teeth/symptoms-causes/syc-20373808
Prediabetes,"Prediabetes means you have a higher than normal blood sugar level. It's not high enough to be considered type 2 diabetes yet. But without lifestyle changes, adults and children with prediabetes are at high risk to develop type 2 diabetes.
If you have prediabetes, the long-term damage of diabetes — especially to your heart, blood vessels and kidneys — may already be starting. There's good news, however. Progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes isn't inevitable.
Eating healthy foods, making physical activity part of your daily routine and staying at a healthy weight can help bring your blood sugar level back to normal. The same lifestyle changes that can help prevent type 2 diabetes in adults might also help bring children's blood sugar levels back to normal.","Prediabetes doesn't usually have any signs or symptoms. | One possible sign of prediabetes is darkened skin on certain parts of the body. Affected areas can include the neck, armpits and groin. | Classic signs and symptoms that suggest you've moved from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes include: | Increased thirst | Frequent urination | Increased hunger | Fatigue | Blurred vision | Numbness or tingling in the feet or hands | Frequent infections | Slow-healing sores | Unintended weight loss",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prediabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20355278

Erectile dysfunction,"Erectile dysfunction means not being able to get and keep an erection firm enough for sexual activity. It also is called impotence.
Having erection trouble from time to time isn't always a cause for concern. But if erectile dysfunction is ongoing, it can cause stress, affect self-confidence and add to challenges with a partner. Problems getting or keeping an erection can be a sign of a health condition that needs treatment and a risk factor for heart disease.
If you're worried about erectile dysfunction, talk to your healthcare professional, even if it's awkward. Sometimes, treating an underlying condition can fix erectile dysfunction. Or you might need medicines or other direct treatments.",Having trouble getting an erection once in a while is common. Erectile dysfunction symptoms are ongoing and often get worse over time. They might include: | Trouble getting an erection. | Trouble keeping an erection. | Wanting sex less.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/erectile-dysfunction/symptoms-causes/syc-20355776
Inherited metabolic disorders,"Inherited metabolic disorders are medical conditions caused by changes in specific genes that affect metabolism. Different gene changes cause different types of inherited metabolic disorders. These gene changes are most commonly passed down from both parents. But sometimes the gene change comes only from one parent, most often from the mother. These disorders also are called inborn errors of metabolism.
Metabolism is the complex set of chemical reactions that your body uses to maintain life. These include:
When these processes don't work properly, a metabolic disorder occurs. It may be due to an enzyme that's too low or missing or to another problem. Inherited metabolic disorders fall into different groups. They're grouped by the substance affected and whether it builds up too much because it can't be broken down or it's too low or missing.","There are hundreds of inherited metabolic disorders caused by different genes. Symptoms depend on the type of disorder and how severe it is. | Examples of inherited metabolic disorders include: | Familial hypercholesterolemia. | Gaucher disease. | Hunter syndrome. | Krabbe disease. | Maple syrup urine disease. | Metachromatic leukodystrophy. | Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes (MELAS). | Niemann-Pick. | Phenylketonuria (PKU). | Porphyria. | Tay-Sachs disease. | Wilson's disease.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inherited-metabolic-disorders/symptoms-causes/syc-20352590
Incompetent cervix,"An incompetent cervix happens when weak cervical tissue causes or plays a part in a premature birth or the loss of a healthy pregnancy. An incompetent cervix also is called cervical insufficiency.
The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that opens to the vagina. Before pregnancy, it's usually closed and firm. As pregnancy goes on and you get ready to give birth, the cervix slowly changes. It softens, gets shorter and opens. If you have an incompetent cervix, it might begin to open too soon causing you to give birth too early.
An incompetent cervix can be a hard problem to diagnose and treat. If your cervix begins to open early, or if you've had cervical insufficiency in the past, you might benefit from treatment. This might include having a procedure done to close the cervix with strong sutures, called a cervical cerclage. You also may take medicine to help the incompetent cervix and have ultrasound exams to check how things are going.","With an incompetent cervix, there may be no signs or symptoms during early pregnancy. Some women have mild discomfort or spotting before the diagnosis. Often, this occurs before 24 weeks of pregnancy. | Be on the lookout for: | A feeling of pelvic pressure. | A new backache. | Mild stomach cramps. | A change in vaginal discharge. | Light vaginal bleeding.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/incompetent-cervix/symptoms-causes/syc-20373836
Fecal incontinence,"Fecal incontinence is accidental passing of solid or liquid stool. Fecal incontinence may happen when a person has a sudden urge to pass stool and cannot get to a toilet in time. Also, stool may leak when a person doesn't sense the need to pass stool.
Common causes of fecal incontinence include diarrhea, constipation, and muscle or nerve damage. Fecal incontinence can affect a person's ability to work, socialize or do typical daily activities. It often causes embarrassment or emotional stress.
Diagnosis and treatment are often avoided because the condition is difficult to discuss with a healthcare professional. Treatments can improve fecal incontinence and overall quality of life.
Fecal incontinence also may be called bowel incontinence or accidental bowel leakage.","The main symptom is not being able to control passing stool. This may happen during a short-term illness that causes diarrhea. For some people, fecal incontinence is an ongoing condition. | There are two types of fecal incontinence: | Urge incontinenceis the sudden urge to pass stool but not being able to control the urge. The need to pass stool may come on so suddenly that it's not possible to get to the toilet in time. | Passive incontinenceis passing stool when a person isn't aware of the need to pass stool. A person may not be able to feel that the rectum is full of stool. | Fecal incontinence also may be leakage of stool when a person passes gas.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fecal-incontinence/symptoms-causes/syc-20351397
Bed-wetting,"Bed-wetting — also called nighttime incontinence or nocturnal enuresis — means passing urine without intending to while asleep. This happens after the age at which staying dry at night can be reasonably expected.
Soggy sheets and pajamas — and an embarrassed child — are a familiar scene in many homes. But don't get upset if your child wets the bed. Bed-wetting isn't a sign of problems with toilet training. It's often just a typical part of a child's development.
Generally, bed-wetting before age 7 isn't a concern. At this age, your child may still be developing nighttime bladder control.
If your child continues to wet the bed, treat the problem with patience and understanding. Lifestyle changes, bladder training, moisture alarms and sometimes medicine may help lessen bed-wetting.","Most kids are fully toilet trained by age 5, but there's really no target date for having complete bladder control. Between the ages of 5 and 7, bed-wetting remains a problem for some children. After 7 years of age, a small number of children still wet the bed.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bed-wetting/symptoms-causes/syc-20366685
Urinary incontinence,"Urinary incontinence — the loss of bladder control — is a common and often embarrassing problem. The severity ranges from occasionally leaking urine when you cough or sneeze to having an urge to urinate that's so sudden and strong you don't get to a toilet in time.
Though it occurs more often as people get older, urinary incontinence isn't an inevitable consequence of aging. If urinary incontinence affects your daily activities, don't hesitate to see your doctor. For most people, simple lifestyle and dietary changes or medical care can treat symptoms of urinary incontinence.","Many people experience occasional, minor leaks of urine. Others may lose small to moderate amounts of urine more frequently. | Types of urinary incontinence include: | Stress incontinence.Urine leaks when you exert pressure on your bladder by coughing, sneezing, laughing, exercising or lifting something heavy. | Urge incontinence.You have a sudden, intense urge to urinate followed by an involuntary loss of urine. You may need to urinate often, including throughout the night. Urge incontinence may be caused by a minor condition, such as infection, or a more severe condition such as a neurological disorder or diabetes. | Overflow incontinence.You experience frequent or constant dribbling of urine due to a bladder that doesn't empty completely. | Functional incontinence.A physical or mental impairment keeps you from making it to the toilet in time. For example, if you have severe arthritis, you may not be able to unbutton your pants quickly enough. | Mixed incontinence.You experience more than one type of urinary incontinence — most often this refers to a combination of stress incontinence and urge incontinence.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-incontinence/symptoms-causes/syc-20352808
Indigestion,"Indigestion — also called dyspepsia or an upset stomach — is discomfort in your upper abdomen. Indigestion describes certain symptoms, such as belly pain and a feeling of fullness soon after you start eating, rather than a specific disease. Indigestion can also be a symptom of other digestive disorders.
Although indigestion is common, each person may experience indigestion in a slightly different way. Symptoms of indigestion may be felt occasionally or as often as daily.
Indigestion may often be relieved with lifestyle changes and medicines.","If you have indigestion, you may have: | Early fullness during a meal.You haven't eaten much of your meal, but you already feel full and may not be able to finish eating. | Uncomfortable fullness after a meal.The feeling of fullness lasts longer than it should. | Discomfort in the upper abdomen.You feel a mild to severe pain in the area between the bottom of your breastbone and your bellybutton. | Burning in the upper abdomen.You feel an uncomfortable heat or burning sensation between the bottom of your breastbone and your bellybutton. | Bloating in the upper abdomen.You feel an uncomfortable sensation of tightness in your upper abdomen. | Nausea.You feel as if you want to vomit. | Less frequent symptoms include vomiting and belching. | Sometimes people with indigestion also experience heartburn.

Infant reflux,"Infant reflux is when a baby spits up liquid or food. It happens when stomach contents move back up from a baby's stomach into the esophagus. The esophagus is the muscular tube that connects the mouth to the stomach.
Reflux happens in infants many times a day. If your baby is content and growing well, reflux is not a cause for concern. Sometimes called gastroesophageal reflux, also called GER, the condition becomes less common as a baby gets older. It's unusual for infant reflux to continue after age 18 months.
Rarely, infant reflux leads to weight loss or growth that lags behind that of other children of the same age and sex. These symptoms may mean that your baby has a medical issue. This issue could be an allergy, a blockage in the digestive system or gastroesophageal reflux disease, also called GERD. GERD is a form of GER that causes serious health issues.","Most of the time, infant reflux isn't a cause for concern. It's not usual for stomach contents to have enough acid to irritate the throat or esophagus and cause symptoms.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/infant-acid-reflux/symptoms-causes/syc-20351408
Hemangioma,"A hemangioma (he-man-jee-O-muh), also known as an infantile hemangioma or hemangioma of infancy, is a bright red birthmark. It looks like a rubbery bump or flat red patch and is made up of extra blood vessels in the skin. The mark shows up at birth or in the first month of life.
A hemangioma typically appears on the face, scalp, chest or back, though it can be anywhere on the skin. Treatment generally isn't needed for a baby's hemangioma, as the mark fades over time. Typically, there is little trace of it by age 10. You may want to think about treatment for the child if a hemangioma leads to problems with vision, breathing or other bodily functions. You also may think about treatment if the hemangioma is in a cosmetically sensitive area.","A hemangioma may be visible at birth, but it appears more often during the first month of life. It starts as a flat red mark on the body, most often on the face, scalp, chest or back. A child generally only has one mark, but some children may have more than one mark. | During your child's first year, the red mark may grow rapidly into a spongy, rubbery-looking bump that sticks out from the skin. The hemangioma then enters a rest phase. Then it will begin to slowly go away. | Many hemangiomas go away by age 5, and most go away by age 10.

Infertility may happen because of a health issue with either you or your partner, or a mix of factors that prevent pregnancy. But many safe and effective treatments can boost your chances of getting pregnant.","The main symptom of infertility is not getting pregnant. There may be no other clear symptoms. Some women with infertility may have irregular menstrual periods or no periods. And some men may have some symptoms of hormonal problems, such as changes in hair growth or sexual function. | Many couples eventually will conceive — with or without treatment.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/infertility/symptoms-causes/syc-20354317
Female infertility,,,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/female-infertility/symptoms-causes/syc-20354308
Male infertility,"Nearly 1 in 7 couples is infertile, which means they haven't been able to conceive a child even though they've had frequent, unprotected sexual intercourse for a year or longer. In up to half of these couples, male infertility plays at least a partial role.
Male infertility can be caused by low sperm production, abnormal sperm function or blockages that prevent the delivery of sperm. Illnesses, injuries, chronic health problems, lifestyle choices and other factors may contribute to male infertility.
The inability to conceive a child can be stressful and frustrating, but a number of treatments are available for male infertility.","The main sign of male infertility is the inability to conceive a child. There may be no other obvious signs or symptoms. | In some cases, however, an underlying problem such as an inherited disorder, hormonal imbalance, dilated veins around the testicle or a condition that blocks the passage of sperm causes signs and symptoms. Signs and symptoms you may notice include: | Problems with sexual function — for example, difficulty with ejaculation or small volumes of fluid ejaculated, reduced sexual desire, or difficulty maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction) | Pain, swelling or a lump in the testicle area | Recurrent respiratory infections | Inability to smell | Abnormal breast growth (gynecomastia) | Decreased facial or body hair or other signs of a chromosomal or hormonal abnormality | A lower than normal sperm count (fewer than 15 million sperm per milliliter of semen or a total sperm count of less than 39 million per ejaculate)",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/male-infertility/symptoms-causes/syc-20374773
Cholecystitis,"Cholecystitis (ko-luh-sis-TIE-tis) is swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ on the right side of the belly under the liver. The gallbladder holds fluid that digests food. This fluid is called bile. The gallbladder releases bile into the small intestine.
Most often, gallstones that block the tube leading out of the gallbladder cause cholecystitis. This results in a bile buildup that can cause inflammation. Other causes of cholecystitis include bile duct changes, tumors, serious illness and certain infections.
If not treated, cholecystitis can lead to serious complications, such as gallbladder rupture. These can be life-threatening. Treatment for cholecystitis often involves surgery to remove the gallbladder.",Symptoms of cholecystitis may include: | Severe pain in the upper right or center belly area. | Pain that spreads to the right shoulder or back. | Tenderness over the belly area when it's touched. | Nausea. | Vomiting. | Fever. | Cholecystitis symptoms often come on after a meal. A large or fatty meal is most likely to cause symptoms.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cholecystitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20364867
Pancreatitis,"Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. Inflammation is immune system activity that can cause swelling, pain, and changes in how an organ or tissues work.
The pancreas is a long, flat gland that's tucked behind the stomach. The pancreas helps the body digest food and regulates blood sugars.
Pancreatitis can be an acute condition. This means it appears suddenly and generally lasts a short time. Chronic pancreatitis is a long-term condition. The damage to the pancreas can get worse over time.
Acute pancreatitis may improve on its own. More-serious disease requires treatment in a hospital and can cause life-threatening complications.","Symptoms of pancreatitis may vary. Acute pancreatitis symptoms may include: | Pain in the upper belly. | Pain in the upper belly that radiates to the back. | Tenderness when touching the belly. | Fever. | Rapid pulse. | Upset stomach. | Vomiting. | Chronic pancreatitis signs and symptoms include: | Pain in the upper belly. | Belly pain that feels worse after eating. | Losing weight without trying. | Oily, smelly stools. | Some people with chronic pancreatitis only develop symptoms after they get complications of the disease.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20360227
Pericarditis,"Pericarditis is swelling and irritation of the thin, saclike tissue surrounding the heart. This tissue is called the pericardium. Pericarditis often causes sharp chest pain. The chest pain occurs when the irritated layers of the pericardium rub against each other.
Pericarditis often is mild. It may go away without treatment. Treatment for more-serious symptoms can include medicines and, very rarely, surgery. When healthcare professionals find and treat pericarditis early, that may help lower the risk of long-term complications from pericarditis.","Chest pain is the most common symptom of pericarditis. It usually feels sharp or stabbing. But some people have dull, achy or pressure-like chest pain. | Most often, pericarditis pain is felt behind the breastbone or on the left side of the chest. The pain may: | Spread to the left shoulder and neck, or to both shoulders. | Get worse when coughing, lying down or taking a deep breath. | Get better when sitting up or leaning forward. | Other symptoms of pericarditis can include: | Cough. | Fatigue or general feeling of weakness or being sick. | Swelling of the legs or feet. | Low-grade fever. | Pounding or racing heartbeat, also called heart palpitations. | Shortness of breath when lying down. | Swelling of the belly, also called the abdomen. | The specific symptoms depend on the type of pericarditis. Pericarditis is grouped into different categories, according to the pattern of symptoms and how long symptoms last. | Acute pericarditisbegins suddenly but doesn't last longer than four weeks. Future episodes can occur. It may be hard to tell the difference between acute pericarditis and pain due to a heart attack. | Recurrent pericarditisoccurs about 4 to 6 weeks after a bout of acute pericarditis. No symptoms happen in between. | Incessant pericarditislasts about 4 to 6 weeks but less than three months. The symptoms continue over this whole time. | Chronic constrictive pericarditisusually develops slowly and lasts longer than three months.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pericarditis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352510
Inflammatory breast cancer,"Inflammatory breast cancer is a form of breast cancer that causes breast swelling and skin changes.
Inflammatory breast cancer happens when a growth of cells forms in the breast tissue. The cells break away from where they started to grow and travel to the lymphatic vessels in the skin. The cells can block the vessels and cause the skin on the breast to look swollen. This skin on the breast might look red or purple.
Inflammatory breast cancer is considered a locally advanced cancer. When a cancer is locally advanced, that means it has spread from where it started to nearby tissue and possibly to nearby lymph nodes.
Inflammatory breast cancer can easily be confused with a breast infection, which is a much more common cause of breast swelling and skin changes. Seek medical attention right away if you notice skin changes on your breast.","Inflammatory breast cancer doesn't commonly form a lump, as occurs with other forms of breast cancer. Instead, signs and symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer include: | Fast change in the appearance of one breast, over the course of several weeks. | Thickness, heaviness or swelling of one breast. | Changes in skin color, giving the breast a red, purple, pink or bruised appearance. | Unusual warmth of the affected breast. | Dimpling or ridges on the skin of the affected breast, similar to an orange peel. | Tenderness, pain or aching. | Enlarged lymph nodes under the arm, above the collarbone or below the collarbone. | Flattened nipple or nipple that turns inward on the affected breast. | For inflammatory breast cancer to be diagnosed, these symptoms must have been present for less than six months.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355413
Influenza (flu),"Flu, also called influenza, is an infection of the nose, throat and lungs, which are part of the respiratory system. The flu is caused by a virus. Influenza viruses are different from the ""stomach flu"" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.
Most people with the flu get better on their own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. To help protect against seasonal flu, you can get an annual flu shot. Although the vaccine isn't 100% effective, it lowers the chances of having severe complications from the flu. This is especially true for people who are at high risk of flu complications.
Aside from the vaccine, you can take other steps to help prevent infection with the flu. You can clean and disinfect surfaces, wash hands, and keep the air around you moving.","The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. In North America, flu season usually runs between October and May. | Symptoms of the flu such as a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose are common. You may also get these symptoms with other illness such as a cold. But colds tend to start slowly, and the flu tends to come on quickly, within two or three days after you come in contact with the virus. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu. | Other common flu symptoms include: | Fever. | Cough. | Headache. | Muscle aches. | Feeling very tired. | Sweating and chills. | In children, these symptoms may show up more generally as being fussy or irritable.

Bird flu (avian influenza),"Bird flu, also called avian influenza, is caused by influenza type A virus infections in bird species. Depending on the strain, bird flu may cause the bird to have no symptoms, mild illness, serious illness or lead to the death of the bird.
Bird flu rarely infects humans. But health officials worry because influenza A viruses that infect birds can change, called mutate, to infect humans and spread from person to person more often. Because a new strain of bird flu would be a new virus to humans, a mutated strain like that could spread quickly around the world.
People most often catch a bird flu virus from close, long-term contact with live, domesticated poultry typically on farms or in backyard coops. People also may catch bird flu through contact with wild birds or another type of animal. Bird flu rarely has spread from person to person.
In humans, flu is a viral infection of the nose, throat and lungs, which are part of the respiratory system. Symptoms of bird flu in humans are similar to flu symptoms and may be mild to serious.","Bird flu symptoms can be mild to serious in a person. Symptoms typically show up within seven days of contact with the virus but can take as long as two weeks. A person can get infected from direct contact with an infected animal, or the bedding or stool of the animal. | Flu viruses have similar symptoms. So you need to be tested to check if you have a bird flu infection. | Common bird flu symptoms include: | Fever. | Problems breathing. | Pink eye, also called conjunctivitis. | Upset stomach and vomiting. | Loose stool, called diarrhea. | Bird flu may cause breathing problems more often than other kinds of flu. And during bird flu pandemics, the risk that a person with flu will need a machine to help them breathe is higher.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bird-flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20568390
H1N1 flu (swine flu),"The H1N1 flu, sometimes called swine flu, is a type of influenza A virus.
During the 2009-10 flu season, a new H1N1 virus began causing illness in humans. It was often called swine flu and was a new combination of influenza viruses that infect pigs, birds and humans.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the H1N1 flu to be a pandemic in 2009. That year the virus caused an estimated 284,400 deaths worldwide. In August 2010,WHOdeclared the pandemic over. But the H1N1 flu strain from the pandemic became one of the strains that cause seasonal flu.
Most people with the flu get better on their own.
But flu and its complications can be deadly, especially for people at high risk. The seasonal flu vaccine can now help protect against the H1N1 flu and other seasonal flu viruses.","The symptoms of flu caused by H1N1, commonly called the swine flu, are similar to those of other flu viruses. | Symptoms usually start quickly and can include: | Fever, but not always. | Aching muscles. | Chills and sweats. | Cough. | Sore throat. | Runny or stuffy nose. | Watery, red eyes. | Eye pain. | Body aches. | Headache. | Tiredness and weakness. | Diarrhea. | Feeling sick to the stomach, vomiting, but this is more common in children than adults. | Flu symptoms develop about 1 to 4 days after you're exposed to the virus.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/swine-flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20378103
Ingrown hair,"Ingrown hair occurs when a hair that's been removed starts to grow back and curves into the skin. Shaving, tweezing or waxing can cause this to happen. An ingrown hair can cause tiny, swollen bumps on the skin that may hurt. The condition most often affects Black people with curly hair who shave.
Most instances of ingrown hair get better without treatment. You can avoid this condition by not removing hair or not shaving very close to the skin. If that's not an option, you might try other hair removal methods that lessen the risk of developing ingrown hair.","Signs and symptoms of ingrown hair include: | Tiny, swollen bumps where you shave, tweeze or wax | Small bumps that look like blisters or are filled with pus | Small bumps that are darker than surrounding skin (hyperpigmentation) | Burning or stinging | Itching | Hair in the shape of a loop because the tip of the hair curves and grows into the skin",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ingrown-hair/symptoms-causes/syc-20373893

Insomnia,"Insomnia is a common sleep disorder that can make it hard to fall asleep or stay asleep. It also can cause you to wake up too early and not be able to get back to sleep. You may still feel tired when you wake up. Insomnia can drain your energy level and affect your mood. It also can affect your health, work performance and quality of life.
How much sleep is enough varies from person to person. But most adults need 7 to 9 hours a night.
At some point, many adults have short-term insomnia. This can last for days or weeks. Short-term insomnia is usually due to stress or a distressing event. But some people have long-term insomnia, also called chronic insomnia. This lasts for three months or more. Insomnia may be the main problem, or it may be related to other medical conditions or medicines.
You do not have to put up with sleepless nights. Simple changes in your daily habits often can help.","Insomnia symptoms may include: | Having a hard time falling asleep at night. | Waking up during the night. | Waking up too early. | Feeling tired or sleepy during the day. | Feeling cranky, depressed or anxious. | Having a hard time paying attention, focusing on tasks or remembering. | Making more errors or having more accidents. | Having ongoing worries about sleep.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/insomnia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355167

Intermittent explosive disorder,"Intermittent explosive disorder involves repeated, sudden bouts of impulsive, aggressive, violent behavior or angry verbal outbursts. The reactions are too extreme for the situation. Road rage, domestic abuse, throwing or breaking objects, or other temper tantrums may be symptoms of intermittent explosive disorder.
These explosive outbursts, which occur off and on, cause major distress. They can harm relationships and cause problems at work or school. They also can result in problems with the law.
Intermittent explosive disorder is a long-term condition that can go on for years. But the severity of outbursts may lessen with age. Treatment involves talk therapy and medicine to help you control your aggressive impulses.","Impulsive attacks and angry outbursts occur suddenly, with little or no warning. They usually last less than 30 minutes. These bouts may occur often or be separated by weeks or months. Verbal outbursts or less severe physical attacks may still occur in between these times.

Interstitial lung disease,"Interstitial (in-tur-STISH-ul) lung disease, also called ILD, describes a large group of conditions. Most of these conditions cause inflammation and progressive scarring of lung tissue. As part of this process, lung tissue thickens and stiffens, making it hard for the lungs to expand and fill with air.
At some point, the scarring from interstitial lung disease makes it harder to breathe and get enough oxygen into the bloodstream. Many people with ILD are short of breath with activity and may have a bothersome dry cough.
Interstitial lung disease can have many causes, including long-term exposure to hazardous materials such as asbestos. Some types of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, also can cause interstitial lung disease. But the cause isn't known sometimes. ILD can have many causes, so treatment varies.
The disease may get worse slowly or rapidly at a pace that often can't be predicted. Once lung scarring occurs, it generally isn't reversible. Treatment focuses on keeping more scarring from occurring, managing symptoms and making quality of life better. Medicines may slow the damage of interstitial lung disease, but many people never fully use their lungs again. Lung transplant is an option for some people who have ILD.",The main symptoms of interstitial lung disease are: | Shortness of breath at rest or shortness of breath that worsens with physical activity. | Dry cough.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/interstitial-lung-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353108
Intestinal ischemia,"Intestinal ischemia (is-KEE-me-uh) refers to a range of conditions that happen when blood flow to the intestines slows or stops. Ischemia can be due to a fully or partly blocked blood vessel, most often an artery. Or low blood pressure may lead to less blood flow. Intestinal ischemia can affect the small intestine, the large intestine or both.
Less blood flow means that too little oxygen goes to the cells in the system through which food travels, called the digestive system. Intestinal ischemia is a serious condition that can cause pain. It can make it hard for the intestines to work well.
In severe cases, loss of blood flow to the intestines can cause lifelong damage to the intestines. And it may lead to death.
There are treatments for intestinal ischemia. Getting medical help early improves the chances of recovery.","Symptoms of intestinal ischemia can come on quickly. When this happens, the condition is called acute intestinal ischemia. When symptoms come on slowly, the condition is called chronic intestinal ischemia. Symptoms may differ from person to person. But certain symptoms suggest a diagnosis of intestinal ischemia.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/intestinal-ischemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373946

Intracranial hematoma,"An intracranial hematoma is a collection of blood within the skull. The blood may collect in the brain tissue or underneath the skull, pressing on the brain. It's usually caused by a blood vessel that bursts in the brain. It also may be caused by a head injury due to a car accident or fall.
Some head injuries, such as one that causes only a short period of unconsciousness, can be minor. However, an intracranial hematoma is potentially life-threatening. It usually requires immediate treatment. This might include surgery to remove the blood.","Symptoms of an intracranial hematoma may develop right after a head injury, or they may take weeks or longer to appear. There may be a period of time without symptoms after a head injury. This is called the lucid interval. | Over time, pressure on the brain increases, producing some or all of the following symptoms: | Headache that gets worse. | Vomiting. | Drowsiness and gradual loss of consciousness. | Dizziness. | Confusion. | Pupils that are different sizes. | Slurred speech. | Loss of movement, known as paralysis, on the opposite side of the body from the head injury.As more blood fills the brain or the narrow space between the brain and skull, other symptoms may appear, such as:Feeling very sleepy or sluggish.Seizures.Loss of consciousness. | Feeling very sleepy or sluggish. | Seizures. | Loss of consciousness.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/intracranial-hematoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20356145
Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS),"Ductal carcinoma in situ is a very early form of breast cancer. In ductal carcinoma in situ, the cancer cells are confined inside a milk duct in the breast. The cancer cells haven't spread into the breast tissue. Ductal carcinoma in situ is often shortened to DCIS. It's sometimes called noninvasive, preinvasive or stage 0 breast cancer.
DCIS is usually found during a mammogram done as part of breast cancer screening or to investigate a breast lump. DCIS has a low risk of spreading and becoming life-threatening. However, it does require an evaluation and a consideration of treatment options.
Treatment for DCIS often involves surgery. Other treatments may combine surgery with radiation therapy or hormone therapy.","Ductal carcinoma in situ doesn't typically cause symptoms. This early form of breast cancer also is called DCIS. | DCIS can sometimes cause symptoms such as: | A breast lump. | Bloody nipple discharge. | DCIS is usually found on a mammogram.

Cholestasis of pregnancy,"Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, commonly known as cholestasis of pregnancy, is a liver condition that can occur in late pregnancy. The condition triggers intense itching, but without a rash. Itching is usually on the hands and feet but also can occur on other parts of the body.
Cholestasis of pregnancy can make you very uncomfortable. But more worrisome are the potential complications, especially for your baby. Because of the risk of complications, your pregnancy care provider may recommend early term delivery around 37 weeks.","Intense itching is the main symptom of cholestasis of pregnancy. But there is no rash. Typically, you feel itchy on the palms of your hands or the soles of your feet, but you may feel itchy everywhere. The itching is often worse at night and may bother you so much that you can't sleep. | The itching is most common during the third trimester of pregnancy but sometimes begins earlier. It may feel worse as your due date gets near.

Invasive lobular carcinoma,"Invasive lobular carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that begins as a growth of cells in the milk-producing glands of the breast. These glands are called lobules.
Invasive cancer means that the cancer cells have broken out of the lobule where they began and spread into the breast tissue. The cells have the potential to spread to the lymph nodes and other areas of the body.
Invasive lobular carcinoma makes up a small portion of all breast cancers. The most common type of breast cancer begins in the breast ducts. This type is called invasive ductal carcinoma.","At first, invasive lobular carcinoma may cause no signs and symptoms. As it grows larger, invasive lobular carcinoma may cause: | A change in the texture or appearance of the skin over the breast, such as dimpling or thickening. | A new area of fullness or swelling in the breast. | A newly inverted nipple. | An area of thickening in part of the breast. | Invasive lobular carcinoma is less likely to cause a firm or distinct breast lump than other types of breast cancer.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/invasive-lobular-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20373973
Iritis,"Iritis (i-RYE-tis) is swelling and irritation (inflammation) in the colored ring around your eye's pupil (iris). Another name for iritis is anterior uveitis.
The uvea is the middle layer of the eye between the retina and the white part of the eye. The iris is located in the front portion (anterior) of the uvea.
Iritis is the most common type of uveitis. Uveitis is inflammation of part of or all of the uvea. The cause is often unknown. It can result from an underlying condition or genetic factor.
If untreated, iritis could lead to glaucoma or vision loss. See your doctor as soon as possible if you have symptoms of iritis.","Iritis can occur in one or both eyes. It usually develops suddenly, and can last up to three months. | Signs and symptoms of iritis include: | Eye redness | Discomfort or achiness in the affected eye | Sensitivity to light | Decreased vision | Iritis that develops suddenly, over hours or days, is known as acute iritis.

Hemochromatosis,"Hemochromatosis (he-moe-kroe-muh-TOE-sis) is a condition that causes the body to absorb too much iron from food. Excess iron is stored in the organs, especially the liver, heart and pancreas. Too much iron can lead to life-threatening conditions, such as liver disease, heart problems and diabetes.
There are a few types of hemochromatosis, but the most common type is caused by a gene change passed down through families. Only a few people who have the genes ever develop serious problems. Symptoms usually appear in midlife.
Treatment includes regularly removing blood from the body. Because much of the body's iron is contained in red blood cells, this treatment lowers iron levels.",Some people with hemochromatosis never have symptoms. Early symptoms often overlap with those of other common conditions. | Symptoms may include: | Joint pain. | Belly pain. | Fatigue. | Weakness. | Diabetes. | Loss of sex drive. | Impotence. | Heart failure. | Liver failure. | Bronze or gray skin color. | Memory fog.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemochromatosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351443

Ischemic colitis,"Ischemic colitis happens when blood flow to part of the large intestine, called the colon, is temporarily reduced. When blood flow slows down, cells in the colon don't get enough oxygen, which may result in damage and swelling of the colon's tissues. Causes of reduced blood flow may include narrowing of the blood vessels supplying the colon or low blood pressure. Ischemic colitis is also called colonic ischemia.
Any part of the colon can be affected, but ischemic colitis most commonly causes pain on the left side of the belly area.
Ischemic colitis can be hard to diagnose because it can easily be confused with other digestive problems. You may need medicine to treat ischemic colitis or prevent infection. Or you may need surgery if your colon has been damaged. Most often, however, ischemic colitis heals on its own.","Symptoms of ischemic colitis can include: | Pain, tenderness or cramping in the belly, which can happen suddenly or happen over time. | Bright red or maroon blood in the stool or, at times, passage of blood alone without stool. | A feeling of urgency to move the bowels. | Diarrhea. | Nausea. | The risk of serious complications is higher when symptoms happen on the right side of the belly. This is less commonly seen compared with left-sided colitis. People with right-sided colitis tend to have more underlying medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation and kidney disease. They more often have to undergo surgery and also have a higher risk of death.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ischemic-colitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20374001

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors,"Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are a rare type of cancer that starts as a growth of cells in the pancreas. The pancreas is a long, flat gland that sits behind the stomach. It makes enzymes and hormones that help digest food.
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors start from the hormone-producing cells in the pancreas. These cells are called islet cells. Another term for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor is islet cell cancer.
Some pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor cells keep making hormones. These are known as functional tumors. Functional tumors create too much of the given hormone. Examples of functional tumors include insulinoma, gastrinoma and glucagonoma.
Most pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors do not produce an excess amount of hormones. Tumors that don't produce extra hormones are called nonfunctional tumors.","Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors sometimes don't cause symptoms. When they do, symptoms can include: | Heartburn. | Weakness. | Fatigue. | Muscle cramps. | Indigestion. | Diarrhea. | Weight loss. | Skin rash. | Constipation. | Pain in the abdomen or back. | Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes. | Dizziness. | Blurred vision. | Headaches. | Increased thirst and hunger.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/symptoms-causes/syc-20352489
Itchy skin (pruritus),"Itchy skin is an irritating sensation that makes you want to scratch. It's also called pruritus (proo-RIE-tus). Itchy skin is often caused by dry skin and is common in older adults, as skin tends to become drier with age.
Depending on the cause of your itchiness, your skin may look no different than usual or it may be inflamed, rough or have bumps. Repeated scratching can cause raised thick areas of skin that might bleed or become infected.
Many people find relief with self-care measures such as moisturizers, gentle cleansers and lukewarm baths. Long-term relief requires identifying and treating the cause of itchy skin. Common treatments are medicated creams, moist dressings and anti-itch medicines taken by mouth.","Itchy skin can affect small areas, such as the scalp, an arm or a leg. Or it can cover the whole body. Itchy skin can occur without any other noticeable changes on the skin. Or it may come with: | Inflamed skin | Scratch marks | Bumps, spots or blisters | Dry, cracked skin | Leathery or scaly patches | Sometimes itchiness lasts a long time and can be intense. As you rub or scratch the area, it gets itchier. And the more it itches, the more you scratch.

Jaw tumors and cysts,"Jaw tumors and cysts are relatively rare growths or lesions that develop in the jawbone or the soft tissues in the mouth and face. Jaw tumors and cysts — sometimes referred to as odontogenic or nonodontogenic, depending on their origin — can vary greatly in size and severity. These growths are usually noncancerous (benign), but they can be aggressive and expand, displace or destroy the surrounding bone, tissue and teeth.
Treatment options for jaw tumors and cysts vary, depending on the type of growth or lesion you have, the stage of growth, and your symptoms. Mouth, jaw and face (oral and maxillofacial) surgeons can treat your jaw tumor or cyst usually by surgery, or in some cases, by medical therapy or a combination of surgery and medical therapy.","A tumor is an abnormal growth or mass of tissue. A cyst is a lesion that contains liquid or semisolid material. Examples of jaw tumors and cysts include: | Ameloblastoma.This rare, usually noncancerous (benign) tumor begins in the cells that form the protective enamel lining on the teeth. It develops most often in the jaw near the molars. The most common type is aggressive, forming large tumors and growing into the jawbone. Although this tumor can recur after treatment, aggressive surgical treatment will typically reduce the chance of recurrence. | Central giant cell granuloma.Central giant cell granulomas are benign lesions that grow from bone cells. They most often occur in the front portion of the lower jaw. One type of these tumors can grow rapidly, cause pain and destroy bone, and has a tendency to recur after surgical treatment. The other type is less aggressive and may not have symptoms. Rarely, a tumor may shrink or resolve on its own, but typically these tumors require surgical treatment. | Dentigerous cyst.This cyst originates from tissue that surrounds a tooth before it erupts into the mouth. This is the most common form of cyst that affects the jaws. Most often these cysts will occur around wisdom teeth that are not fully erupted, but they can also involve other teeth. | Odontogenic keratocyst.This cyst is also referred to as a keratocystic odontogenic tumor because of its tumorlike tendency to recur after surgical treatment. Although this cyst is typically slow growing, it can still be destructive to the jaw and teeth if left untreated over a long period of time. Most often the cyst develops in the lower jaw near the third molars. These cysts may also be found in people with an inherited condition called nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. | Odontogenic myxoma.This is a rare, slow-growing, benign tumor that occurs most often in the lower jaw. The tumor can be large and aggressively invade the jaw and surrounding tissue and displace teeth. Odontogenic myxomas are known to recur after surgical treatment; however, the chances of tumor recurrence are typically lessened by more-aggressive forms of surgical treatment. | Odontoma.This benign tumor is the most common odontogenic tumor. Odontomas often have no symptoms, but they may interfere with tooth development or eruption. Odontomas are made up of dental tissue that grows around a tooth in the jaw. They can resemble an oddly shaped tooth or can be a small or large calcified tumor. These tumors may be part of some genetic syndromes. | Other types of cysts and tumors.These include adenomatoid odontogenic tumor, calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor, glandular odontogenic cyst, squamous odontogenic tumor, calcifying odontogenic cyst, cementoblastoma, aneurysmal bone cyst, ossifying fibroma, osteoblastoma. central odontogenic fibroma and others.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/jaw-tumors-cysts/symptoms-causes/syc-20350973
Jellyfish stings,"Jellyfish stings are fairly common problems for people swimming, wading or diving in oceans. The long tentacles trailing from the jellyfish can inject venom from thousands of microscopic barbed stingers.
Most often jellyfish stings cause instant pain and inflamed marks on the skin. Some stings may cause more whole-body (systemic) illness. And in rare cases they're life-threatening.
Most jellyfish stings get better over a few days or weeks with home treatment. Severe reactions likely need emergency medical care.","Symptoms of jellyfish stings include: | Burning, prickling, stinging pain | Welts or tracks on the skin — a ""print"" of the tentacles' contact with the skin | Itchiness (pruritus) | Swelling | Throbbing pain that radiates up a leg or an arm | Severe jellyfish stings can affect multiple body systems.

Symptoms of severe jellyfish stings include: | Stomach pain, nausea and vomiting | Headache | Muscle pain or spasms | Faintness, dizziness or confusion | Difficulty breathing | Heart problems | The severity of a reaction depends on: | The type and size of the jellyfish | The age, size and health of the person affected, with severe reactions more likely in children | How long the person was exposed to the stingers | How much of the skin is affected",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/jellyfish-stings/symptoms-causes/syc-20353284
Jet lag disorder,"Jet lag, also called jet lag disorder, is a temporary sleep problem that can affect anyone who quickly travels across several time zones.
Your body has its own internal clock, called circadian rhythms. They signal to your body when to stay awake and when to sleep.
Jet lag occurs because your body's internal clock is synced to your original time zone. It hasn't changed to the time zone of where you've traveled. The more time zones crossed, the more likely you are to experience jet lag.
Jet lag can cause daytime fatigue, an unwell feeling, trouble staying alert and stomach problems. Although symptoms are temporary, they can affect your comfort while on vacation or during a business trip. But you can take steps to help prevent or lessen the effects of jet lag.",Symptoms of jet lag can vary. You may experience only one symptom or you may have many. Jet lag symptoms may include: | Sleep problems such as not being able to fall asleep or waking up early. | Daytime fatigue. | Not being able to focus or function at your usual level. | Stomach problems such as constipation or diarrhea. | A general feeling of not being well. | Mood changes.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/jet-lag/symptoms-causes/syc-20374027

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, formerly known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, is the most common type of arthritis in children under the age of 16.
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis can cause persistent joint pain, swelling and stiffness. Some children may experience symptoms for only a few months, while others have symptoms for many years.
Some types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis can cause serious complications, such as growth problems, joint damage and eye inflammation. Treatment focuses on controlling pain and inflammation, improving function, and preventing damage.","The most common signs and symptoms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis are: | Pain.While your child might not complain of joint pain, you may notice that he or she limps — especially first thing in the morning or after a nap. | Swelling.Joint swelling is common but is often first noticed in larger joints such as the knee. | Stiffness.You might notice that your child appears clumsier than usual, particularly in the morning or after naps. | Fever, swollen lymph nodes and rash.In some cases, high fever, swollen lymph nodes or a rash on the trunk may occur — which is usually worse in the evenings. | Juvenile idiopathic arthritis can affect one joint or many. There are several different subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, but the main ones are systemic, oligoarticular and polyarticular. Which type your child has depends on symptoms, the number of joints affected, and if a fever and rashes are prominent features. | Like other forms of arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis is characterized by times when symptoms flare up and times when symptoms may be minimal.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20374082
Childhood schizophrenia,"Childhood schizophrenia is an uncommon but severe mental disorder in which children and teenagers interpret reality abnormally. Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking (cognitive), behavior or emotions. It may result in some combination of hallucinations, delusions, and extremely disordered thinking and behavior that impairs your child's ability to function.
Childhood schizophrenia is essentially the same as schizophrenia in adults, but it starts early in life — generally in the teenage years — and has a profound impact on a child's behavior and development. With childhood schizophrenia, the early age of onset presents special challenges for diagnosis, treatment, education, and emotional and social development.
Schizophrenia is a chronic condition that requires lifelong treatment. Identifying and starting treatment for childhood schizophrenia as early as possible may significantly improve your child's long-term outcome.","Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking, behavior or emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. The effect can be disabling. | In most people with schizophrenia, symptoms generally start in the mid- to late 20s, though it can start later, up to the mid-30s. Schizophrenia is considered early onset when it starts before the age of 18. Onset of schizophrenia in children younger than age 13 is extremely rare. | Symptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with periods of worsening and remission of symptoms.

Kaposi sarcoma,"Kaposi sarcoma is a type of cancer that forms in the lining of blood vessels and lymph vessels. The cancer forms growths of cells, called lesions, on the skin. The lesions often form on the face, arms and legs. The lesions may look pink, red, purple or brown.
Lesions also can appear on the genitals or in the mouth. In severe Kaposi sarcoma, lesions can be in the digestive tract and lungs.
The cause of Kaposi sarcoma is infection with the virus human herpes virus 8, also called HHV-8. In healthy people, this infection usually causes no symptoms because the immune system keeps it under control. In someone with a weakened immune system, however, HHV-8 can lead to Kaposi sarcoma.
Types of Kaposi sarcoma include:","Kaposi sarcoma signs and symptoms include: | A growth on the skin that may be raised or flat. | A growth on the skin that looks red, purple or brown in color. | The growths, called lesions, most often happen on the face, arms or legs. They usually don't cause discomfort. | If Kaposi sarcoma isn't treated, the lesions can get bigger. They may cause: | Swelling in the lower legs caused by blood flow problems. | Enlarged lymph nodes. | Skin that appears red or purple in color and may be painful and itchy. | Kaposi sarcoma also can affect areas you can't see. It can grow in the digestive tract or lungs. When Kaposi sarcoma happens in the digestive tract, symptoms may include: | Diarrhea. | Nausea. | Stomach pain. | Vomiting. | Weight loss.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kaposis-sarcoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20577303
Kawasaki disease,"Kawasaki disease causes swelling, called inflammation, in the walls of small to medium-sized blood vessels that carry blood throughout the body. Kawasaki disease most often affects the heart arteries in children. Those arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart.
Kawasaki disease  is sometimes called mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. That's because it also causes swelling in glands, called lymph nodes, and mucous membranes inside the mouth, nose, eyes and throat.
Children with Kawasaki disease might have high fever, swollen hands and feet with skin peeling, and red eyes and tongue. But Kawasaki disease is often treatable. With early treatment, most children get better and have no long-lasting problems.","Symptoms of Kawasaki disease include a fever greater than 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius) for five or more days. And the child  has at least four of the following symptoms. | A rash on the main part of the body or in the genital area. | An enlarged lymph node in the neck. | Very red eyes without a thick discharge. | Red, dry, cracked lips and a red, swollen tongue. | Swollen, red skin on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Later the skin on fingers and toes peels. | The symptoms might not happen at the same time. Let your child's healthcare professional know about a symptom that has gone away. | Other symptoms might include: | Belly pain. | Diarrhea. | Fussiness. | Joint pain. | Vomiting. | Some children get a high fever for five or more days but have fewer than four of the symptoms needed for a diagnosis of Kawasaki disease. They might have what's called incomplete Kawasaki disease. Children with incomplete Kawasaki disease are still at risk of damage to the heart arteries. They still need treatment within 10 days of when symptoms appear. | Kawasaki disease can have symptoms like those of a condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. The syndrome happens in children with COVID-19.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kawasaki-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354598
Keloid scar,"A keloid scar is a thick raised scar. It can occur wherever you have a skin injury but usually forms on earlobes, shoulders, cheeks or the chest. If you're prone to developing keloids, you might get them in more than one place.
A keloid scar isn't harmful to your physical health, but it can cause emotional distress. Prevention or early treatment is key.
Keloid scar treatment is possible. If you don't like how a keloid looks or feels, talk with a doctor about how to flatten or remove it. Even with treatment, a keloid can last for years or recur.","A keloid scar may form within months to years of the inciting injury. Signs and symptoms might include: | Thick, irregular scarring, typically on the earlobes, shoulders, cheeks or middle chest | Shiny, hairless, lumpy, raised skin | Varied size, depending on the size of the original injury and when the keloid stops growing | Varied texture, from soft to firm and rubbery | Reddish, brown or purplish, depending on your skin color | Itchiness | Discomfort",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/keloid-scar/symptoms-causes/syc-20520901
Keratitis,"Keratitis is an inflammation of the cornea — the clear, dome-shaped tissue on the front of your eye that covers the pupil and iris. Keratitis may or may not be associated with an infection. Noninfectious keratitis can be caused by a relatively minor injury, such as from wearing your contact lenses too long or getting a foreign body in the eye. Infectious keratitis can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites.
If you have eye redness or other symptoms of keratitis, make an appointment to see an eye specialist. With prompt attention, mild to moderate cases of keratitis can usually be effectively treated without loss of vision. If left untreated, or if an infection is severe, keratitis can lead to serious complications that may permanently damage your vision.","Symptoms of keratitis include: | Eye redness | Eye pain | Excess tears or other discharge from your eye | Difficulty opening your eyelid because of pain or irritation | Blurred vision | Decreased vision | Sensitivity to light, called photophobia | A feeling that something is in your eye",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/keratitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20374110
Dry eyes,,,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dry-eyes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371863
Keratoconus,"Keratoconus (ker-uh-toe-KOH-nus) is an eye condition in which the clear, dome-shaped front of the eye, called the cornea, gets thinner, steeper and bulges outward into a cone shape.
A cone-shaped cornea causes blurred vision and may cause sensitivity to light and glare. Keratoconus usually affects both eyes. However, it can affect one eye more than the other. It generally begins to affect people between the late teens and 30 years of age. The condition may progress slowly for 10 years or longer.
In the early stages of keratoconus, you might be able to correct vision problems with glasses or soft contact lenses. Later, you may have to be fitted with rigid, gas permeable contact lenses or other types of lenses, such as scleral lenses. If your condition gets worse, you may need a cornea transplant.
A procedure called corneal collagen cross-linking may help to slow or stop keratoconus from progressing, possibly preventing the need for a future cornea transplant. This treatment may be offered in addition to the vision correction options above.","Symptoms of keratoconus may change as the disease progresses. They include: | Blurred or distorted vision. | Increased sensitivity to bright light and glare, which can cause problems with night driving. | A need for frequent changes in eyeglass prescriptions. | Sudden worsening or clouding of vision.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/keratoconus/symptoms-causes/syc-20351352
Keratosis pilaris,"Keratosis pilaris (ker-uh-TOE-sis pih-LAIR-is) is a harmless skin condition that causes dry, rough patches and tiny bumps, often on the upper arms, thighs, cheeks or buttocks. The bumps usually don't hurt or itch.
Keratosis pilaris is often considered a common variant of skin. It can't be cured or prevented. But you can treat it with moisturizers and prescription creams to help improve how the skin looks. The condition usually disappears by age 30.","Keratosis pilaris can occur at any age, but it's more common in young children. Symptoms include: | Painless tiny bumps on the upper arms, thighs, cheeks or buttocks | Dry, rough skin in the areas with bumps | Worsening when seasonal changes cause low humidity and dry skin | Sandpaper-like bumps resembling goose flesh",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/keratosis-pilaris/symptoms-causes/syc-20351149

Kidney cancer,"Kidney cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the kidneys. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They're located behind the abdominal organs, with one kidney on each side of the spine.
In adults, renal cell carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer. Other, less common types of kidney cancer can happen. Young children are more likely to develop a kind of kidney cancer called Wilms tumor.
The number of kidney cancers diagnosed each year seems to be increasing. One reason for this may be the fact that imaging techniques such as CT scans are being used more often. These tests may lead to the incidental discovery of more kidney cancers. Kidney cancer is often found when the cancer is small and confined to the kidney.","Kidney cancer doesn't usually cause symptoms at first. In time, signs and symptoms may develop, including: | Blood in the urine, which may appear pink, red or cola colored. | Loss of appetite. | Pain in the side or back that doesn't go away. | Tiredness. | Unexplained weight loss.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352664
Kidney cysts,"Kidney cysts are round pouches of fluid that form on or in the kidneys. Kidney cysts can occur with disorders that may impair kidney function. But more often, kidney cysts are a type called simple kidney cysts. Simple kidney cysts aren't cancer and rarely cause problems.
It's not clear what causes simple kidney cysts. Often, one cyst occurs on the surface of a kidney. But more than one cyst can appear on one or both kidneys. Simple kidney cysts aren't the same as cysts that form with polycystic kidney disease. Simple cysts also differ from complex cysts. Complex cysts need to be watched for changes that could be cancer.
Simple kidney cysts are often found during an imaging test for another condition. Treatment usually isn't needed unless simple cysts cause symptoms.","Simple kidney cysts typically don't cause symptoms. But if a simple kidney cyst grows large enough, symptoms may include: | Dull pain in the back or side | Fever | Upper stomach pain",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-cysts/symptoms-causes/syc-20374134
Chronic kidney disease,"Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, involves a gradual loss of kidney function. Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then removed in your urine. Advanced chronic kidney disease can cause dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes to build up in your body.
In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you might have few signs or symptoms. You might not realize that you have kidney disease until the condition is advanced.
Treatment for chronic kidney disease focuses on slowing the progression of kidney damage, usually by controlling the cause. But, even controlling the cause might not keep kidney damage from progressing. Chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal without artificial filtering (dialysis) or a kidney transplant.","Signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease develop over time if kidney damage progresses slowly. Loss of kidney function can cause a buildup of fluid or body waste or electrolyte problems. Depending on how severe it is, loss of kidney function can cause: | Nausea | Vomiting | Loss of appetite | Fatigue and weakness | Sleep problems | Urinating more or less | Decreased mental sharpness | Muscle cramps | Swelling of feet and ankles | Dry, itchy skin | High blood pressure (hypertension) that's difficult to control | Shortness of breath, if fluid builds up in the lungs | Chest pain, if fluid builds up around the lining of the heart | Signs and symptoms of kidney disease are often nonspecific. This means they can also be caused by other illnesses. Because your kidneys are able to make up for lost function, you might not develop signs and symptoms until irreversible damage has occurred.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354521
Kidney infection,"A kidney infection is a type of urinary tract infection (UTI). A kidney infection may begin in the tube that carries urine from the body (urethra) or in the bladder. The infection can travel to one or both kidneys. A kidney infection is also called pyelonephritis.
A kidney infection needs prompt medical treatment. If not treated properly, an infection can cause lasting damage to the kidneys. Or the bacteria can spread to the bloodstream and cause a dangerous infection.
Kidney infection treatment often includes antibiotics, which might be given in the hospital.","Symptoms of a kidney infection might include: | Fever | Chills | A burning feeling or pain when urinating | Having to urinate often | A strong, lasting urge to urinate | Back, side or groin pain | Nausea and vomiting | Pus or blood in the urine | Urine that smells bad or is cloudy | Belly pain",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20353387
Kidney stones,"Kidney stones (also called renal calculi, nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis) are hard deposits made of minerals and salts that form inside your kidneys.
Diet, excess body weight, some medical conditions, and certain supplements and medications are among the many causes of kidney stones. Kidney stones can affect any part of your urinary tract — from your kidneys to your bladder. Often, stones form when the urine becomes concentrated, allowing minerals to crystallize and stick together.
Passing kidney stones can be quite painful, but the stones usually cause no permanent damage if they're recognized in a timely fashion. Depending on your situation, you may need nothing more than to take pain medication and drink lots of water to pass a kidney stone.  In other instances — for example, if stones become lodged in the urinary tract, are associated with a urinary infection or cause complications — surgery may be needed.
Your doctor may recommend preventive treatment to reduce your risk of recurrent kidney stones if you're at increased risk of developing them again.","A kidney stone usually will not cause symptoms until it moves around within the kidney or passes into one of the ureters. The ureters are the tubes that connect the kidneys and bladder. | If a kidney stone becomes lodged in the ureters, it may block the flow of urine and cause the kidney to swell and the ureter to spasm, which can be very painful. At that point, you may experience these symptoms: | Severe, sharp pain in the side and back, below the ribs | Pain that radiates to the lower abdomen and groin | Pain that comes in waves and fluctuates in intensity | Pain or burning sensation while urinating | Other signs and symptoms may include: | Pink, red or brown urine | Cloudy or foul-smelling urine | A persistent need to urinate, urinating more often than usual or urinating in small amounts | Nausea and vomiting | Fever and chills if an infection is present | Pain caused by a kidney stone may change — for instance, shifting to a different location or increasing in intensity — as the stone moves through your urinary tract.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-stones/symptoms-causes/syc-20355755

Kleptomania,"Kleptomania (klep-toe-MAY-nee-uh) is a mental health disorder that involves repeatedly being unable to resist urges to steal items that you generally don't really need. Often the items stolen have little value and you could afford to buy them. Kleptomania is rare but can be a serious condition. It can cause much emotional pain to you and your loved ones — and even legal problems — if not treated.
Kleptomania is a type of impulse control disorder — a disorder that involves problems with emotional or behavioral self-control. If you have an impulse control disorder, you have difficulty resisting the temptation or powerful urge to perform an act that's excessive or harmful to you or someone else.
Many people with kleptomania live lives of secret shame because they're afraid to seek mental health treatment. Although there's no cure for kleptomania, treatment with medicine or skill-building therapy that focuses on dealing with urges may help to end the cycle of compulsive stealing.","Kleptomania symptoms may include: | Inability to resist powerful urges to steal items that you don't need | Feeling increased tension, anxiety or arousal leading up to the theft | Feeling pleasure, relief or satisfaction while stealing | Feeling terrible guilt, remorse, self-loathing, shame or fear of arrest after the theft | Return of the urges and a repetition of the kleptomania cycle",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kleptomania/symptoms-causes/syc-20364732
Klinefelter syndrome,"Klinefelter syndrome is a common condition that results when a person assigned male at birth has an extra copy of the X sex chromosome instead of the typical XY. Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic condition that occurs before birth, but it often isn't diagnosed until adulthood.
Klinefelter syndrome may affect testicular growth. This results in smaller testicles, which can lead to making less of the hormone testosterone. The syndrome also may cause smaller muscle mass, less body and facial hair, and extra breast tissue. The effects of Klinefelter syndrome vary, and not everyone has the same symptoms.
Most people with Klinefelter syndrome produce little or no sperm, but assisted reproductive procedures may make it possible for some people with Klinefelter syndrome to have biological children.","Symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome vary widely. Many children with Klinefelter syndrome show few or only mild symptoms. Most often the condition isn't diagnosed until puberty or adulthood, or it may never be diagnosed. For others, the condition has a noticeable effect on growth or appearance. Klinefelter syndrome may affect development, physical appearance, sexual development and mental health.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/klinefelter-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20353949
Knee bursitis,"Knee bursitis is a condition in which one or more small fluid-filled sacs near the knee joint become inflamed. The sacs are called bursae. Bursae reduce friction and cushion pressure points between bones and tendons, muscles and skin near the joints.
Any of the bursae in the knee can be affected by painful swelling, also called inflammation. But most often, knee bursitis happens over the kneecap or on the inner side of the knee below the joint.
Knee bursitis causes pain and can limit your movement. Treatment often includes a mix of self-care techniques and medical treatments to ease pain and inflammation.","Knee bursitis symptoms vary. They depend on which bursa is affected and what's causing the inflammation. | The affected portion of your knee might feel warm, tender and swollen. You also might feel pain when you move or when you're at rest. | A direct blow to the knee can cause symptoms to come on fast. But knee bursitis often stems from friction and irritation of the bursae. This can occur with jobs that require a lot of kneeling on hard surfaces. So, the symptoms can start slowly and become worse over time.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/knee-bursitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355501
Knee pain,"Knee pain is a common complaint that affects people of all ages. Knee pain may be the result of an injury, such as a ruptured ligament or torn cartilage. Medical conditions — including arthritis, gout and infections — also can cause knee pain.
Many types of minor knee pain respond well to self-care measures. Physical therapy and knee braces also can help relieve pain. In some cases, however, your knee may require surgical repair.","The location and severity of knee pain may vary, depending on the cause of the problem. Signs and symptoms that sometimes accompany knee pain include: | Swelling and stiffness | Redness and warmth to the touch | Weakness or instability | Popping or crunching noises | Inability to fully straighten the knee",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/knee-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20350849
Kyphosis,"Kyphosis is an excessive forward rounding of the upper back.
In older people, kyphosis is often due to weakness in the spinal bones that causes them to compress or crack. Other types of kyphosis can appear in infants or teens. These types are due to malformation of the spine or wedging of the spinal bones over time.
Mild kyphosis causes few problems. Serious kyphosis can cause pain and be disfiguring. Treatment for kyphosis depends on your age, and the cause and seriousness of the curvature.","Mild kyphosis may not have any noticeable symptoms. In fact, the upper back naturally has a little kyphosis. People who have excessive curvature may experience back pain and stiffness.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kyphosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20374205

Mastitis,"Mastitis is swelling and redness, called inflammation, of breast tissue. It sometimes involves an infection. Besides causing swelling and redness, mastitis causes breast pain and warmth. An infection also can cause fever and chills.
Mastitis most often affects people who are breastfeeding. This is called lactation mastitis. But mastitis can happen to people who aren't breastfeeding.
Lactation mastitis can cause you to feel run down, making it hard to care for your baby. Sometimes mastitis causes people to wean their babies earlier than they meant to. But continuing to breastfeed is better for you and your baby. This is true even if you're taking an antibiotic.","Symptoms of mastitis can appear suddenly. They may be in one or both breasts. Symptoms may include: | Breast tenderness or warmth. | Breast swelling. | Thickening of breast tissue, or a breast lump. | Pain or a burning feeling all the time or while breastfeeding. | Skin redness, often in a wedge-shaped pattern. The redness may be harder to see on Black or brown skin. | Feeling ill. | Fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 degrees Celsius) or greater.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mastitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20374829

Some viral hemorrhagic fevers include:
These diseases most often happen in tropical areas, such as Central Africa. In the United States, most people who get them have traveled to one of those areas.
There are vaccines and treatments for only a few types of viral hemorrhagic fevers. Until there are vaccines for more of them, do your best to keep from getting viral hemorrhagic fevers.","Symptoms of viral hemorrhagic fevers vary by disease.

Tennis elbow,"Tennis elbow, also known as lateral epicondylitis, is a condition that can result from overuse of the muscles and tendons in the elbow. Tennis elbow is often linked to repeated motions of the wrist and arm.
Despite its name, most people who get tennis elbow don't play tennis. Some people have jobs that involve repeated movements that can lead to tennis elbow. These include plumbers, painters, carpenters and butchers. However, often tennis elbow has no clear cause.
The pain of tennis elbow occurs mainly where the tough, cord-like tissues of the forearm muscles attach to a bony bump on the outside of the elbow. The tissues are known as tendons. Pain can spread into the forearm and wrist.
Rest, pain medicines and physical therapy often help relieve tennis elbow. People for whom these treatments don't help or who have symptoms that get in the way of daily living might have a procedure, such as a shot or surgery.",The pain of tennis elbow can travel from the outside of the elbow into the forearm and wrist. Pain and weakness can make it hard to: | Shake hands or grip an object. | Turn a doorknob. | Hold a coffee cup.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tennis-elbow/symptoms-causes/syc-20351987
Latex allergy,"Latex allergy is a reaction to certain proteins found in natural rubber latex, a product made from the rubber tree. If you have a latex allergy, your body mistakes latex for a harmful substance.
Latex allergy may cause itchy skin and hives or even anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a possibly life-threatening condition that can cause throat swelling and serious difficulty breathing. A healthcare professional can find out if you have a latex allergy or if you're at risk of developing a latex allergy.
Understanding latex allergy and knowing common sources of latex can help you prevent allergic reactions.","If you're allergic to latex, you're likely to have symptoms after touching latex rubber products, such as gloves or balloons. You also can have symptoms if you breathe in latex particles that are released into the air when someone removes latex gloves. | Latex allergy symptoms range from mild to serious.

Left ventricular hypertrophy,"Left ventricular hypertrophy is thickening of the walls of the lower left heart chamber. The lower left heart chamber is called the left ventricle. The left ventricle is the heart's main pumping chamber.
During left ventricular hypertrophy, the thickened heart wall can become stiff. Blood pressure in the heart increases. The changes make it harder for the heart to effectively pump blood. Eventually, the heart may fail to pump with as much force as needed.
Uncontrolled high blood pressure is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. Complications include irregular heart rhythms, called arrhythmias, and heart failure.
Treatment of left ventricular hypertrophy depends on the cause. Treatment may include medications or surgery.","Left ventricular hypertrophy usually develops gradually. Some people do not have symptoms, especially during the early stages of the condition. | Left ventricular hypertrophy itself doesn't cause symptoms. But symptoms may occur as the strain on the heart worsens. They may include: | Shortness of breath, especially while lying down. | Swelling of the legs. | Chest pain, often when exercising. | Sensation of rapid, fluttering or pounding heartbeats, called palpitations. | Fainting or a feeling of lightheadedness.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/left-ventricular-hypertrophy/symptoms-causes/syc-20374314
Broken leg,"A broken leg (leg fracture) is a break or crack in one of the bones in your leg. Common causes include falls, motor vehicle accidents and sports injuries.
Treatment of a broken leg depends on the location and severity of the injury. A severely broken leg may require metal pins and plates to hold the fragments together. Less severe breaks may be treated with a cast or splint. In all cases, prompt diagnosis and treatment are critical to complete healing.","The thighbone (femur) is the strongest bone in the body. It is usually obvious when the thighbone is broken because it takes so much force to break. But a break in the shinbone (tibia) or in the bone that runs alongside the shinbone (fibula) may be less obvious. | Signs and symptoms of a broken leg may include: | Severe pain, which may worsen with movement | Swelling | Tenderness | Bruising | Obvious deformity or shortening of the affected leg | Inability to walk | Toddlers or young children who break a leg may start limping or simply stop walking, even if they can't explain why.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-leg/symptoms-causes/syc-20370412
Legg-Calve-Perthes disease,"Legg-Calve-Perthes (LEG-kahl-VAY-PER-tuz) disease is a childhood condition that occurs when blood supply to the ball part (femoral head) of the hip joint is temporarily interrupted and the bone begins to die.
This weakened bone gradually breaks apart and can lose its round shape. The body eventually restores blood supply to the ball, and the ball heals. But if the ball is no longer round after it heals, it can cause pain and stiffness. The complete process of bone death, fracture and renewal can take several years.
To keep the ball part of the joint as round as possible, doctors use a variety of treatments that keep it snug in the socket portion of the joint. The socket acts as a mold for the fragmented femoral head as it heals.","Symptoms of Perthes disease include: | Limping. | Pain or stiffness in the hip, groin, thigh or knee. | Limited range of motion of the hip joint. | Pain that worsens with activity and improves with rest. | Perthes disease usually involves just one hip.

Leiomyosarcoma most often starts in the smooth muscle tissue in the uterus, belly or leg. It starts as a growth of cells. It often grows quickly and can move to other parts of the body.
Symptoms of leiomyosarcoma depend on where the cancer starts. There may be no symptoms early in the condition.
Leiomyosarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma. Soft tissue sarcoma is a broad group of cancers that begin in the connective tissues.

Leukemia,"Leukemia is cancer of the body's blood-forming tissues, including the bone marrow and the lymphatic system.
Many types of leukemia exist. Some forms of leukemia are more common in children. Other forms of leukemia occur mostly in adults.
Leukemia usually involves the white blood cells. Your white blood cells are potent infection fighters — they normally grow and divide in an orderly way, as your body needs them. But in people with leukemia, the bone marrow produces an excessive amount of abnormal white blood cells, which don't function properly.
Treatment for leukemia can be complex — depending on the type of leukemia and other factors. But there are strategies and resources that can help make your treatment successful.","Leukemia symptoms vary, depending on the type of leukemia. Common leukemia signs and symptoms include: | Fever or chills | Persistent fatigue, weakness | Frequent or severe infections | Losing weight without trying | Swollen lymph nodes, enlarged liver or spleen | Easy bleeding or bruising | Recurrent nosebleeds | Tiny red spots in your skin (petechiae) | Excessive sweating, especially at night | Bone pain or tenderness",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20374373
Acute lymphocytic leukemia,"Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow — the spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are made.
The word ""acute"" in acute lymphocytic leukemia comes from the fact that the disease progresses rapidly and creates immature blood cells, rather than mature ones. The word ""lymphocytic"" in acute lymphocytic leukemia refers to the white blood cells called lymphocytes, whichALLaffects. Acute lymphocytic leukemia is also known as acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Acute lymphocytic leukemia is the most common type of cancer in children, and treatments result in a good chance for a cure. Acute lymphocytic leukemia can also occur in adults, though the chance of a cure is greatly reduced.","Signs and symptoms of acute lymphocytic leukemia may include: | Bleeding from the gums | Bone pain | Fever | Frequent infections | Frequent or severe nosebleeds | Lumps caused by swollen lymph nodes in and around the neck, armpits, abdomen or groin | Pale skin | Shortness of breath | Weakness, fatigue or a general decrease in energy",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-lymphocytic-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369077

The word ""acute"" in acute myelogenous leukemia means the disease tends to get worse quickly. It's called myelogenous (my-uh-LOHJ-uh-nus) leukemia because it affects cells called the myeloid cells. These typically develop into mature blood cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.
AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. The other type is acute lymphoblastic leukemia, also called ALL. Although AML can be diagnosed at any age, it is less common before age 45. AML also is called acute myeloid leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, acute granulocytic leukemia and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.
Unlike other cancers, there are no numbered stages of acute myelogenous leukemia.","Symptoms of acute myelogenous leukemia may include: | Fever. | Pain. Common places for pain include the bones, back and stomach. | Feeling very tired. | Paleness or change in skin color. | Frequent infections. | Easy bruising. | Bleeding with no clear cause, such as in the nose or gums. | Shortness of breath.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-myelogenous-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369109
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow — the spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are made.
The term ""chronic"" in chronic lymphocytic leukemia comes from the fact that this leukemia typically progresses more slowly than other types of leukemia. The term ""lymphocytic"" in chronic lymphocytic leukemia comes from the cells affected by the disease — a group of white blood cells called lymphocytes, which help your body fight infection.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia most commonly affects older adults. There are treatments to help control the disease.","Many people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia have no symptoms at first. Signs and symptoms might develop as the cancer progresses. They might include: | Enlarged, but painless, lymph nodes | Fatigue | Fever | Pain in the upper left portion of the abdomen, which may be caused by an enlarged spleen | Night sweats | Weight loss | Frequent infections",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352428
Chronic myelogenous leukemia,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia, also calledCML, is an uncommon type of cancer of the bone marrow. Bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are made.CMLcauses an increased number of white blood cells in the blood.
The term ""chronic"" in chronic myelogenous leukemia means this cancer tends to progress more slowly than severe forms of leukemia. The term ""myelogenous"" (my-uh-LOHJ-uh-nus) refers to the type of cells affected by this cancer.
Chronic myelogenous leukemia also can be called chronic myeloid leukemia and chronic granulocytic leukemia. It typically affects older adults and rarely occurs in children, though it can occur at any age.
Advances in treatment have improved the prognosis of people with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Most people can achieve remission and live for many years after diagnosis.","Chronic myelogenous leukemia often doesn't cause symptoms. It might be detected during a blood test. | When they occur, symptoms may include: | Bone pain. | Bleeding easily. | Feeling full after eating a small amount of food. | Fatigue. | Fever. | Weight loss without trying. | Loss of appetite. | Pain or fullness below the ribs on the left side. | Excessive sweating during sleep. | Blurry vision caused by bleeding in the back of the eye.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-myelogenous-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352417
Leukoplakia,"Leukoplakia (loo-koh-PLAY-key-uh) causes thick, white patches that form on the gums. The patches also may form on the insides of the cheeks and the bottom of the mouth. Sometimes the patches form on the tongue. These patches cannot be scraped off.
Doctors do not know the exact cause of leukoplakia. But ongoing irritation from tobacco — whether smoked, dipped or chewed — may be the most common cause. Long-term alcohol use is another possible cause.
Most leukoplakia patches are not cancer. But some patches show early signs of cancer. Cancers in the mouth can occur next to areas of leukoplakia. White areas mixed with red areas, also called speckled leukoplakia, may possibly lead to cancer. It's best to see your dentist or doctor if you have any changes in your mouth that do not go away.
A type of leukoplakia in the mouth called hairy leukoplakia mainly affects people whose immune systems have been weakened by disease, especially HIV/AIDS.","Leukoplakia usually occurs on the gums, the insides of the cheeks, the bottom of the mouth under the tongue and, sometimes, the tongue. Usually it is not painful and it may not be noticed for a while. | Leukoplakia may appear as: | White or gray patches that cannot be wiped away. | Patches with a rough, ridged, wrinkled or smooth surface, or a combination of these. | Patches with shapes and edges that are not regular. | Thick or hard patches. | White patches of leukoplakia may appear along with raised, red areas called erythroplakia (uh-rith-roe-PLAY-key-uh). This combination is called speckled leukoplakia. These patches are more likely to show changes that may lead to cancer.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/leukoplakia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354405
Lewy body dementia,"Lewy body dementia is the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. Protein deposits called Lewy bodies develop in nerve cells in the brain. The protein deposits affect brain regions involved in thinking, memory and movement. This condition is also known as dementia with Lewy bodies.
Lewy body dementia causes a decline in mental abilities that gradually gets worse over time. People with Lewy body dementia might see things that aren't there. This is known as visual hallucinations. They also may have changes in alertness and attention.
People with Lewy body dementia might experience Parkinson's disease symptoms. These symptoms may include rigid muscles, slow movement, trouble walking and tremors.","Lewy body dementia symptoms can include: | Visual hallucinations.Seeing things that aren't there, known as hallucinations, might be one of the first symptoms of Lewy body dementia. This symptom often occurs regularly. People with Lewy body dementia might see shapes, animals or people that aren't there. Hallucinations involving sounds, smells or touch are possible. | Movement disorders.Signs of Parkinson's disease, known as parkinsonian signs, may occur. These symptoms include slowed movement, rigid muscles, tremor or a shuffling walk. This can cause the person to fall. | Poor regulation of body functions.The part of the nervous system that controls automatic functions is called the autonomic nervous system. Lewy body dementia can affect how well the autonomic nervous system controls blood pressure, heart rate, sweating and digestion. This can result in sudden drops in blood pressure upon standing, dizziness, falls, loss of bladder control and bowel issues such as constipation. | Cognitive problems.People with Lewy body dementia might have thinking problems similar to those of Alzheimer's disease. They may include confusion, poor attention, visual-spatial problems and memory loss. | Trouble with sleep.People with Lewy body dementia can have rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder. This disorder causes people to physically act out their dreams while asleep. People withREMsleep behavior disorder may punch, kick, yell or scream while sleeping. | Varying attention.Episodes of drowsiness, long periods of staring into space, long naps during the day or disorganized speech are possible. | Depression.People with Lewy body dementia might develop depression. | Apathy.Loss of motivation may occur.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lewy-body-dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352025

Lichen planus,"Lichen planus (LIE-kun PLAY-nus) is a condition of the skin, hair, nails, mouth and genitals. On skin, lichen planus often appears as purple, itchy, flat bumps that develop over several weeks. In the mouth and genital mucosa, lichen planus forms lacy white patches, sometimes with painful sores.
Mild lichen planus of the skin may not need treatment. If the condition causes pain or intense itching, you may need prescription medicine.","Symptoms of lichen planus vary depending on the part of the body affected. Nail disease usually affects several nails. Symptoms include: | Purple, shiny, flat bumps, often on the inner forearms, wrists or ankles. | Lines of rash where the skin has been scratched. | Lacy white patches on the tongue or inside of the cheeks. | Itchiness. | Painful sores in the mouth or genitals. | Rarely, hair loss. | Nail scarring or loss. | Dark lines from the tip of the nail to the base.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lichen-planus/symptoms-causes/syc-20351378

Oral lichen planus can't be passed from one person to another. The condition occurs when the immune system attacks cells of the oral mucous membranes for reasons that aren't known.
Symptoms usually can be managed. But people who have oral lichen planus need regular checkups. That's because oral lichen planus — especially the erosive type — may raise the risk of getting mouth cancer in the affected areas.",Symptoms of oral lichen planus affect the mucous membranes of the mouth.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/oral-lichen-planus/symptoms-causes/syc-20350869
Lichen sclerosus,"Lichen sclerosus (LIE-kun skluh-ROW-sus) is a condition that causes patchy, discolored, thin skin. It usually affects the genital and anal areas.
Anyone can get lichen sclerosus but postmenopausal women are at higher risk. It isn't contagious and can't be spread through sexual contact.
Treatment is usually a medicated ointment. This treatment helps return the skin to its usual color and reduces the risk of scarring. Even if your symptoms clear up, they tend to come back. So you'll likely need long-term follow-up care.","It's possible to have mild lichen sclerosus with no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they usually affect the skin of the genital and anal areas. The back, shoulders, upper arms and breasts may also be affected. Symptoms may include: | Smooth discolored skin patches | Blotchy, wrinkled skin patches | Itching | Soreness or a burning feeling | Easy bruising | Fragile skin | Changes in the tube for urine flow (urethra) | Bleeding, blistering or open sores | Painful sex",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lichen-sclerosus/symptoms-causes/syc-20374448
Neurodermatitis,"Neurodermatitis is a skin condition that starts with an itchy patch of skin. Scratching makes it itch more. With more scratching, the skin becomes thick and leathery. You may develop several itchy spots, typically on the neck, wrists, forearms, legs or groin area.
Neurodermatitis — also known as lichen simplex chronicus — is not life-threatening or contagious. But the itching can be so intense it disrupts your sleep, sexual function and quality of life.
Breaking the itch-scratch cycle of neurodermatitis is challenging, and neurodermatitis is usually a long-term condition. It may clear up with treatment but often returns. Treatment focuses on controlling the itching and preventing scratching. It also may help to identify and eliminate factors that worsen your symptoms, such as dry skin.","Symptoms of neurodermatitis include: | An itchy, scaly skin patch or patches | Open sores that bleed | Thick, leathery skin | Discolored, wrinkled genital skin | Raised, rough patches that are inflamed or darker than the rest of the skin | The condition involves areas that can be reached for scratching — the scalp, neck, wrists, forearms, ankles, vulva, scrotum and anus.

You may scratch your skin out of habit and while sleeping.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/neurodermatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20375634
Lip cancer,"Lip cancer occurs on the skin of the lips. Lip cancer can occur anywhere along the upper or lower lip, but is most common on the lower lip. Lip cancer is considered a type of mouth (oral) cancer.
Most lip cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, which means they begin in the thin, flat cells in the middle and outer layers of the skin called squamous cells.
Lip cancer risk factors include excessive sun exposure and tobacco use. You may reduce your risk of lip cancer by protecting your face from the sun with a hat or sunblock, and by quitting smoking.
Treatment for lip cancer usually involves surgery to remove the cancer. For small lip cancers, surgery may be a minor procedure with minimal impact on your appearance.
For larger lip cancers, more extensive surgery may be necessary. Careful planning and reconstruction can preserve your ability to eat and speak normally, and also achieve a satisfactory appearance after surgery.","Signs and symptoms of lip cancer include: | A flat or slightly raised whitish discoloration of the lip | A sore on your lip that won't heal | Tingling, pain or numbness of the lips or the skin around the mouth",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lip-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355079

Liposarcoma,"Liposarcoma is a rare type of cancer that starts in the fat cells. It most often begins as a growth of cells in the belly or in the arm and leg muscles. But liposarcoma can begin in the fat cells anywhere in the body.
Liposarcoma happens most often in older adults, but it can happen at any age.
Liposarcoma treatment usually involves surgery to remove the cancer. Other treatments, such as radiation therapy, also may be used.
Liposarcoma is a type of cancer called a soft tissue sarcoma. These cancers happen in the body's connective tissues. There are many types of soft tissue sarcoma.","Liposarcoma symptoms depend on the part of the body where the cancer forms. | Liposarcoma in the arms and legs can cause: | A growing lump of tissue under the skin. | Pain. | Swelling. | Weakness of the affected limb. | Liposarcoma in the belly, also called the abdomen, can cause: | Abdominal pain. | Abdominal swelling. | Feeling full sooner when eating. | Constipation. | Blood in stool.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/liposarcoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352632

Liver cancer,"Liver cancer is cancer that begins in the cells of your liver. Your liver is a football-sized organ that sits in the upper right portion of your abdomen, beneath your diaphragm and above your stomach.
Several types of cancer can form in the liver. The most common type of liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma, which begins in the main type of liver cell (hepatocyte). Other types of liver cancer, such as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and hepatoblastoma, are much less common.
Cancer that spreads to the liver is more common than cancer that begins in the liver cells. Cancer that begins in another area of the body — such as the colon, lung or breast — and then spreads to the liver is called metastatic cancer rather than liver cancer. This type of cancer is named after the organ in which it began — such as metastatic colon cancer to describe cancer that begins in the colon and spreads to the liver.","Most people don't have signs and symptoms in the early stages of primary liver cancer. When signs and symptoms do appear, they may include: | Losing weight without trying | Loss of appetite | Upper abdominal pain | Nausea and vomiting | General weakness and fatigue | Abdominal swelling | Yellow discoloration of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice) | White, chalky stools",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/liver-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353659
Liver disease,"The liver is an organ that sits just under the rib cage on the right side of the abdomen. It can weigh up to 4 pounds (1.8 kilograms). The liver is needed to help digest food, rid the body of waste products and make substances, called clotting factors, that keep the blood flowing well, among other tasks.
Liver disease can be passed through families, called inherited. Anything that damages the liver also can cause liver problems, including viruses, alcohol use and obesity.
Over time, conditions that damage the liver can lead to scarring, called cirrhosis. Cirrhosis can lead to liver failure, a life-threatening condition. But early treatment may give the liver time to heal.","Liver disease doesn't always cause symptoms that can be seen or felt. If there are symptoms of liver disease, they may include: | Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, called jaundice. Yellowing of the skin might be harder to see on Black or brown skin. | Belly pain and swelling. | Swelling in the legs and ankles. | Itchy skin. | Dark urine. | Pale stool. | Constant tiredness. | Nausea or vomiting. | Loss of appetite. | Bruising easily.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/liver-problems/symptoms-causes/syc-20374502
Acute liver failure,"Acute liver failure is loss of liver function that happens quickly — in days or weeks — usually in a person who has no preexisting liver disease. It's most often caused by a hepatitis virus or drugs, such as acetaminophen. Acute liver failure is less common than chronic liver failure, which develops more slowly.
Acute liver failure, also known as fulminant hepatic failure, can cause serious complications, including bleeding and increased pressure in the brain. It's a medical emergency that requires hospitalization.
Depending on the cause, acute liver failure can sometimes be reversed with treatment. In many situations, though, a liver transplant may be the only cure.","Symptoms of acute liver failure may include: | Yellowing of the skin and eyeballs, called jaundice. | Pain in the upper right belly area, called the abdomen. | A swollen belly, known as ascites. | Nausea and vomiting. | A general sense of feeling unwell, known as malaise. | Disorientation or confusion. | Sleepiness. | Breath with a musty or sweet odor. | Tremors.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-liver-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20352863

Morphea,"Morphea (mor-FEE-uh) is a rare condition that causes painless, discolored patches on your skin.
Typically, the skin changes appear on the belly, chest or back. But they might also appear on your face, arms and legs. Over time the patches may become firm, dry and smooth. Morphea tends to affect only the outer layers of your skin. But some forms of the condition also affect deeper tissues and may restrict movement in the joints.
Morphea usually improves on its own over time, though recurrences are common. In the meantime, medications and therapies are available to help treat the skin discoloration and other effects.","Signs and symptoms of morphea vary depending on the type and stage of the condition. They include: | Reddish or purplish oval patches of skin, often on the belly, chest or back | Patches that gradually develop a lighter or whitish center | Linear patches, especially on the arms or legs and possibly the forehead or scalp | A gradual change in the affected skin, which becomes firm, thickened, dry and shiny | Morphea affects the skin and underlying tissue and sometimes bone.

Tetanus,"Tetanus is a serious disease of the nervous system caused by a toxin-producing bacterium. The disease causes muscle contractions, particularly of your jaw and neck muscles. Tetanus is commonly known as lockjaw.
Severe complications of tetanus can be life-threatening. There's no cure for tetanus. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and complications until the effects of the tetanus toxin resolve.
Because of the widespread use of vaccines, cases of tetanus are rare in the United States and other parts of the developed world. The disease remains a threat to people who aren't up to date on their vaccinations. It's more common in developing countries.","The average time from infection to appearance of signs and symptoms (incubation period) is 10 days. The incubation period can range from 3 to 21 days. | The most common type of tetanus is called generalized tetanus. Signs and symptoms begin gradually and then progressively worsen over two weeks.

Usually, the neck and back arch, the legs become rigid, the arms are drawn up to the body, and the fists are clenched. Muscle rigidity in the neck and abdomen may cause breathing difficulties. | These severe spasms may be triggered by minor events that stimulate the senses — a loud sound, a physical touch, a draft or light. | As the disease progresses, other signs and symptoms may include: | High blood pressure | Low blood pressure | Rapid heart rate | Fever | Extreme sweating",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tetanus/symptoms-causes/syc-20351625
Long QT syndrome,"Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a heart rhythm disorder that causes fast, chaotic heartbeats. The irregular heartbeats can be life-threatening.LQTSaffects the electrical signals that travel through the heart and cause it to beat.
Some people are born with changes in DNA that cause long QT syndrome. This is known as congenital long QT syndrome.LQTSalso can happen later in life due to some health conditions, certain medicines or changes in the levels of body minerals. This is called acquired long QT syndrome.
Long QT syndrome can cause sudden fainting and seizures. Young people withLQTSsyndrome have a higher risk of sudden cardiac death.
Treatment for long QT syndrome includes lifestyle changes and medicines to prevent dangerous heartbeats. Sometimes a medical device or surgery is needed.","The most common symptom of long QT syndrome is fainting, also called syncope. A fainting spell fromLQTScan happen with little to no warning. | Fainting happens when the heart beats in an irregular way for a short time. You might faint when you're excited, angry or scared, or during exercise.

Urinary incontinence,"Urinary incontinence — the loss of bladder control — is a common and often embarrassing problem. The severity ranges from occasionally leaking urine when you cough or sneeze to having an urge to urinate that's so sudden and strong you don't get to a toilet in time.
Though it occurs more often as people get older, urinary incontinence isn't an inevitable consequence of aging. If urinary incontinence affects your daily activities, don't hesitate to see your doctor. For most people, simple lifestyle and dietary changes or medical care can treat symptoms of urinary incontinence.","Many people experience occasional, minor leaks of urine. Others may lose small to moderate amounts of urine more frequently. | Types of urinary incontinence include: | Stress incontinence.Urine leaks when you exert pressure on your bladder by coughing, sneezing, laughing, exercising or lifting something heavy. | Urge incontinence.You have a sudden, intense urge to urinate followed by an involuntary loss of urine. You may need to urinate often, including throughout the night. Urge incontinence may be caused by a minor condition, such as infection, or a more severe condition such as a neurological disorder or diabetes. | Overflow incontinence.You experience frequent or constant dribbling of urine due to a bladder that doesn't empty completely. | Functional incontinence.A physical or mental impairment keeps you from making it to the toilet in time.

Low blood pressure (hypotension),"Low blood pressure is a condition in which the force of the blood pushing against the artery walls is too low. It's also called hypotension.
Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). In general, low blood pressure is a reading lower than 90/60 mm Hg.
What's considered low blood pressure for one person might be OK for someone else though. Low blood pressure might cause no symptoms that you notice. Or it might cause dizziness and fainting. Sometimes, low blood pressure can be life-threatening.
The causes of low blood pressure include dehydration and other serious medical conditions. It's important to find out what's causing low blood pressure so that it can be treated, if needed.","Low blood pressure symptoms can include: | Blurred or fading vision. | Dizzy or lightheaded feelings. | Fainting. | Fatigue. | Trouble concentrating. | Upset stomach. | For some people, low blood pressure may be a symptom of an underlying health condition. That's especially so when blood pressure drops suddenly or when low blood pressure occurs with symptoms. | A sudden fall in blood pressure can be dangerous. A change of just 20 mm Hg can make you feel dizzy or faint. For example, those symptoms could happen after a drop in systolic pressure from 110 mm Hg to 90 mm Hg. And big drops can be life-threatening. These can happen for reasons such as serious bleeding, serious infections or allergic reactions. | Extreme low blood pressure can lead to a condition known as shock. Symptoms of shock include: | Confusion, especially in older people. | Cold, clammy skin. | Decrease in skin color, also called pallor. | Rapid, shallow breathing. | Weak and rapid pulse.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/low-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20355465
Hypoglycemia,"Hypoglycemia is a condition in which your blood sugar (glucose) level is lower than the standard range. Glucose is your body's main energy source.
Hypoglycemia is often related to diabetes treatment. But other drugs and a variety of conditions — many rare — can cause low blood sugar in people who don't have diabetes.
Hypoglycemia needs immediate treatment. For many people, a fasting blood sugar of 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 3.9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L), or below should serve as an alert for hypoglycemia. But your numbers might be different. Ask your health care provider.
Treatment involves quickly getting your blood sugar back to within the standard range either with a high-sugar food or drink or with medication. Long-term treatment requires identifying and treating the cause of hypoglycemia.","If blood sugar levels become too low, hypoglycemia signs and symptoms can include: | Looking pale | Shakiness | Sweating | Headache | Hunger or nausea | An irregular or fast heartbeat | Fatigue | Irritability or anxiety | Difficulty concentrating | Dizziness or lightheadedness | Tingling or numbness of the lips, tongue or cheek | As hypoglycemia worsens, signs and symptoms can include: | Confusion, unusual behavior or both, such as the inability to complete routine tasks | Loss of coordination | Slurred speech | Blurry vision or tunnel vision | Nightmares, if asleep | Severe hypoglycemia may cause: | Unresponsiveness (loss of consciousness) | Seizures",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypoglycemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373685
Hypothermia,"Hypothermia is a condition that occurs when core body temperature drops below 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius). It is a medical emergency. In hypothermia (hi-poe-THUR-me-uh), the body loses heat faster than it can produce heat, causing a dangerously low body temperature. Regular body temperature is around 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius).
When body temperature drops, the heart, nervous system and other organs can't work as well as they usually do. Left untreated, hypothermia can cause the heart and respiratory system to fail and eventually can lead to death.
Common causes of hypothermia include exposure to cold weather or immersion in cold water. Treatment for hypothermia includes methods to warm the body back to a regular temperature.","When the temperature starts to drop, the body can start to shiver. Shivering is the body's attempt to warm itself. It is an automatic defense against cold temperature. | Symptoms of hypothermia include: | Shivering. | Slurred speech or mumbling. | Slow, shallow breathing. | Weak pulse. | Clumsiness or lack of coordination. | Drowsiness or very low energy. | Confusion or memory loss. | Loss of consciousness. | In infants, bright red, cold skin. | People with hypothermia usually aren't aware of their condition. The symptoms often begin gradually. Also, the confused thinking associated with hypothermia prevents self-awareness.

Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count),"Thrombocytopenia is a condition in which you have a low blood platelet count. Platelets (thrombocytes) are colorless blood cells that help blood clot. Platelets stop bleeding by clumping and forming plugs in blood vessel injuries.
Thrombocytopenia might occur as a result of a bone marrow disorder such as leukemia or an immune system problem. Or it can be a side effect of taking certain medications. It affects both children and adults.
Thrombocytopenia can be mild and cause few signs or symptoms. In rare cases, the number of platelets can be so low that dangerous internal bleeding occurs. Treatment options are available.","Thrombocytopenia signs and symptoms may include: | Easy or excessive bruising (purpura) | Superficial bleeding into the skin that appears as a rash of pinpoint-sized reddish-purple spots (petechiae), usually on the lower legs | Prolonged bleeding from cuts | Bleeding from your gums or nose | Blood in urine or stools | Unusually heavy menstrual flows | Fatigue | Enlarged spleen",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thrombocytopenia/symptoms-causes/syc-20378293
Low sex drive in women,"Women's levels of sexual desire change over the years. It's common for highs and lows to happen along with the start or end of a relationship. Or they can happen with major life changes such as pregnancy, menopause or illness. Some medicines used for conditions that affect mood also can cause low sex drive in women.
If your lack of interest in sex continues or returns and causes personal distress, talk with your healthcare professional. You may have a treatable condition called sexual interest-arousal disorder.
But you don't have to meet this medical definition to seek help. If you're bothered by a low or reduced sex drive, you can take steps to boost your libido. Lifestyle changes and sexual techniques may put you in the mood more often. Some medicines may offer promise as well.","neither of you may have a sex drive that's outside what's typical for people at your stage in life. | And even if your sex drive is lower than it once was, your relationship may be strong. Bottom line: There is no magic number to define low sex drive. It varies. | Symptoms of low sex drive in women include: | Having less or no interest in any type of sexual activity, including masturbation. | Never or only seldom having sexual fantasies or thoughts. | Being sad or concerned about your lack of sexual activity or fantasies.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/low-sex-drive-in-women/symptoms-causes/syc-20374554
Low sperm count,"A low sperm count means there is less sperm than is typical in fluid called semen that the penis releases during orgasm.
A low sperm count also is called oligospermia (ol-ih-go-SPUR-me-uh). A complete lack of sperm is called azoospermia (ay-zoh-uh-SPUR-me-uh). Your sperm count is considered lower than typical if you have fewer than 15 million sperm per milliliter of semen.
Having a low sperm count makes it less likely that one of your sperm will join with your partner's egg to start a pregnancy. If needed, there are treatments to help couples boost their chances of becoming pregnant.","The main symptom of a low sperm count is not being able to start a pregnancy. There might be no other clear symptoms. | In some people, an underlying health condition causes a low sperm count along with other symptoms. Depending on the condition, these other symptoms can include: | Trouble with sexual function — for example, some people have low sex drive. Others have trouble getting or keeping an erection that's firm enough for sex, also called erectile dysfunction. | Pain, swelling or a lump in the testicle area. | Less facial or body hair or other symptoms of a chromosome or hormone condition.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/low-sperm-count/symptoms-causes/syc-20374585

Lung cancer,"Lung cancer is a kind of cancer that starts as a growth of cells in the lungs. The lungs are two spongy organs in the chest that control breathing.
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.
People who smoke have the greatest risk of lung cancer. The risk of lung cancer increases with the length of time and number of cigarettes smoked. Quitting smoking, even after smoking for many years, significantly lowers the chances of developing lung cancer. Lung cancer also can happen in people who have never smoked.","Lung cancer typically doesn't cause symptoms early on. Symptoms of lung cancer usually happen when the disease is advanced. | Signs and symptoms of lung cancer that happen in and around the lungs may include: | A new cough that doesn't go away. | Chest pain. | Coughing up blood, even a small amount. | Hoarseness. | Shortness of breath. | Wheezing. | Signs and symptoms that happen when lung cancer spreads to other parts of the body may include: | Bone pain. | Headache. | Losing weight without trying. | Loss of appetite. | Swelling in the face or neck.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lung-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20374620
Pneumothorax,"A pneumothorax (noo-moe-THOR-aks) is a collapsed lung. A pneumothorax occurs when air leaks into the space between your lung and chest wall. This air pushes on the outside of your lung and makes it collapse. A pneumothorax can be a complete lung collapse or a collapse of only a portion of the lung.
A pneumothorax can be caused by a blunt or penetrating chest injury, certain medical procedures, or damage from underlying lung disease. Or it may occur for no obvious reason. Symptoms usually include sudden chest pain and shortness of breath. On some occasions, a collapsed lung can be a life-threatening event.
Treatment for a pneumothorax usually involves inserting a needle or chest tube between the ribs to remove the excess air. However, a small pneumothorax may heal on its own.",The main symptoms of a pneumothorax are sudden chest pain and shortness of breath. Severity of symptoms may depend on how much of the lung is collapsed.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumothorax/symptoms-causes/syc-20350367
Atelectasis,"Atelectasis (at-uh-LEK-tuh-sis) is the collapse of a lung or part of a lung, also known as a lobe. It happens when tiny air sacs within the lung, called alveoli, lose air.
Atelectasis is one of the most common breathing complications after surgery. It's also a possible complication of other respiratory problems, including cystic fibrosis, lung tumors, chest injuries, fluid in the lung and respiratory weakness. You may develop atelectasis if you breathe in a foreign object.
This condition can make breathing hard, particularly if you already have lung disease. Treatment depends on what's causing the collapse and how severe it is.
The definition of atelectasis is broader than pneumothorax (noo-moe-THOR-aks). Pneumothorax is when air leaks into the space between your lungs and chest wall, causing part or all of a lung to collapse. Pneumothorax is one of several causes of atelectasis.","There may be no clear signs of atelectasis. If you have any signs, they may include: | Having a hard time breathing. | Rapid, weak breathing. | Wheezing. | Coughing.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atelectasis/symptoms-causes/syc-20369684
Interstitial lung disease,"Interstitial (in-tur-STISH-ul) lung disease, also called ILD, describes a large group of conditions. Most of these conditions cause inflammation and progressive scarring of lung tissue. As part of this process, lung tissue thickens and stiffens, making it hard for the lungs to expand and fill with air.
At some point, the scarring from interstitial lung disease makes it harder to breathe and get enough oxygen into the bloodstream. Many people with ILD are short of breath with activity and may have a bothersome dry cough.
Interstitial lung disease can have many causes, including long-term exposure to hazardous materials such as asbestos. Some types of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, also can cause interstitial lung disease. But the cause isn't known sometimes. ILD can have many causes, so treatment varies.
The disease may get worse slowly or rapidly at a pace that often can't be predicted. Once lung scarring occurs, it generally isn't reversible. Treatment focuses on keeping more scarring from occurring, managing symptoms and making quality of life better. Medicines may slow the damage of interstitial lung disease, but many people never fully use their lungs again. Lung transplant is an option for some people who have ILD.",The main symptoms of interstitial lung disease are: | Shortness of breath at rest or shortness of breath that worsens with physical activity. | Dry cough.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/interstitial-lung-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353108

Lyme disease,"Lyme disease is an illness caused by borrelia bacteria. Humans usually get Lyme disease from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria.
Ticks that can carry borrelia bacteria live throughout most of the United States. But Lyme disease is most common in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. It's also common in Europe and in south central and southeastern Canada.
You're at risk of Lyme disease if you spend time where the ticks live, such as grassy, brushy or wooded areas. Taking safety measures in these areas can lower the risk of Lyme disease.","A tick bite may look like as a tiny, itchy bump on your skin, much like a mosquito bite. This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite. | The symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap.

Swollen lymph nodes,,,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/swollen-lymph-nodes/symptoms-causes/syc-20353902
Mesenteric lymphadenitis,"Lymphadenitis is a condition in which the small round or bean-shaped clusters of cells, called lymph nodes, become swollen and inflamed. The swelling can affect the lymph nodes in the membrane that connects the bowel to the wall around the stomach area, called the mesentery. Then the condition is called mesenteric lymphadenitis (mez-un-TER-ik lim-fad-uh-NIE-tis).
An infection in the intestines, such as a virus, is the usual cause of mesenteric lymphadenitis. Also called mesenteric adenitis, the condition mainly affects children and teens.
Mesenteric lymphadenitis can act like appendicitis or a condition in which part of the intestine slides into another part of the intestine, called intussusception. Unlike appendicitis or intussusception, mesenteric lymphadenitis usually clears up on its own.","Possible symptoms of mesenteric lymphadenitis include: | Pain in the stomach area, often on the lower right side, but the pain can be more spread out. | General tenderness of the stomach area. | Fever. | Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. | Depending on what's causing the condition, symptoms also might include: | Diarrhea. | Nausea and vomiting.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mesenteric-lymphadenitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353799
Lymphedema,"Lymphedema refers to tissue swelling caused by an accumulation of protein-rich fluid that's usually drained through the body's lymphatic system. It most commonly affects the arms or legs, but can also occur in the chest wall, abdomen, neck and genitals.
Lymph nodes are an important part of your lymphatic system. Lymphedema can be caused by cancer treatments that remove or damage your lymph nodes. Any type of problem that blocks the drainage of lymph fluid can cause lymphedema.
Severe cases of lymphedema can affect the ability to move the affected limb, increase the risks of skin infections and sepsis, and can lead to skin changes and breakdown. Treatment may include compression bandages, massage, compression stockings, sequential pneumatic pumping, careful skin care and, rarely, surgery to remove swollen tissue or to create new drainage routes.","Lymphedema signs and symptoms include: | Swelling of part or all of the arm or leg, including fingers or toes | A feeling of heaviness or tightness | Restricted range of motion | Recurring infections | Hardening and thickening of the skin (fibrosis) | Signs and symptoms can range from mild to severe.

Lymphoma,"Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is part of the body's germ-fighting and disease-fighting immune system. Lymphoma begins when healthy cells in the lymphatic system change and grow out of control.
The lymphatic system includes lymph nodes. They are found throughout the body. Most lymph nodes are in the abdomen, groin, pelvis, chest, underarms and neck.
The lymphatic system also includes the spleen, thymus, tonsils and bone marrow. Lymphoma can affect all these areas and other organs in the body.
There are many types of lymphoma. The main subtypes are:
Many treatments for lymphoma exist. The treatment that's best for you will depend on the type of lymphoma you have. Treatments can control the disease and give many people with lymphoma the chance of a full recovery.","Signs and symptoms of lymphoma may include: | Fever. | Night sweats. | Fatigue. | Itchy skin. | Painless swelling of lymph nodes in the belly, neck, armpits or groin. | Pain in chest, abdomen or bones. | Losing weight without trying.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lymphoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352638
Hodgkin lymphoma (Hodgkin disease),"Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is part of the body's germ-fighting and disease-fighting immune system. Hodgkin lymphoma begins when healthy cells in the lymphatic system change and grow out of control.
The lymphatic system includes lymph nodes. They are found throughout the body. Most lymph nodes are in the abdomen, groin, pelvis, chest, underarms and neck.
The lymphatic system also includes the spleen, thymus, tonsils and bone marrow. Hodgkin lymphoma can affect all these areas and other organs in the body.
Hodgkin lymphoma, which used to be called Hodgkin disease, is one of two broad types of lymphoma. The other is non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Advances in diagnosis and treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma have helped give people with this disease the chance for a full recovery.","Signs and symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma may include: | Painless swelling of lymph nodes in the neck, armpits or groin. | Fever. | Feeling very tired. | Night sweats. | Weight loss that happens without trying. | Itchy skin.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hodgkins-lymphoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352646
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma,"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is made up of organs, glands, tubelike vessels and clusters of cells called lymph nodes. It's part of the body's germ-fighting immune system.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma happens when germ-fighting cells in the lymphatic system grow out of control. The cells can form growths, called tumors, throughout the body.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a broad group of lymphomas. There are many subtypes in this group. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma are among the most common subtypes. The other broad group of lymphoma is Hodgkin lymphoma.
Advances in diagnosis and treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma have helped improve the prognosis for people with this condition.","Signs and symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma may include: | Swollen lymph nodes in the neck, armpits or groin. | Belly pain or swelling. | Chest pain, coughing or trouble breathing. | Feeling very tired. | Fever. | Night sweats. | Weight loss without trying.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/non-hodgkins-lymphoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20375680
Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia,"Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (mak-roe-glob-u-lih-NEE-me-uh) is a type of cancer that begins in the white blood cells. Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is considered a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It's sometimes called lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.
In Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, some white blood cells undergo changes that turn them into cancer cells. The cancer cells can build up in the spongy material inside the bones where blood cells are made. This material is called bone marrow. The cancer cells crowd healthy blood cells out of the bone marrow. Cancer cells also may build up in other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes and the spleen.
The cancer cells make a protein that can build up in the blood. Too much of the protein can reduce blood flow in the body and cause other problems.","Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia grows slowly. It might not cause symptoms for years. | When they happen, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia symptoms may include: | Fatigue. | Fever. | Weight loss. | Night sweats. | Numbness in the hands or feet. | Swollen lymph nodes. | A feeling of pain or fullness under the ribs on your left side, which may be caused by an enlarged spleen. | Easy bruising. | Bleeding nose or gums. | Headache. | Shortness of breath. | Changes in vision. | Confusion.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20359967
Lynch syndrome,"Lynch syndrome is a condition that increases the risk of many kinds of cancer. This condition is passed from parents to children.
Families that have Lynch syndrome have more instances of cancer than expected. This might include colon cancer, endometrial cancer and other types of cancer. Lynch syndrome also causes cancers to happen at an earlier age.
People with Lynch syndrome may need careful testing to look for cancer when it's small. Treatment is more likely to be successful when the cancer is caught early. Some people with Lynch syndrome might consider treatments to prevent cancer.
Lynch syndrome used to be called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC).HNPCCis a term used to describe families with a strong history of colon cancer. Lynch syndrome is the term used when healthcare professionals find a gene that runs in the family and causes cancer.","People with Lynch syndrome may experience: | Colon cancer before age 50 | Cancer of the inside lining of the uterus (endometrial cancer) before age 50 | A personal history of more than one type of cancer | A family history of cancer before age 50 | A family history of other cancers caused by Lynch syndrome, including stomach cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, ureteral cancer, brain cancer, small bowel cancer, gallbladder cancer, bile duct cancer and skin cancer",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lynch-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20374714
Dry macular degeneration,"Dry macular degeneration is an eye condition that causes blurred vision or reduced central vision. It is caused by the breakdown of a part of the retina known as the macula (MAK-u-luh). The macula is responsible for central vision. This condition is common among people over 50.
Dry macular degeneration may start in one eye then develop in the other eye. It also may develop in both eyes at the same time. Over time, vision may worsen and affect the ability to do things, such as read, drive and recognize faces. But having dry macular degeneration doesn't mean you'll lose all your sight. Vision loss is typically central, and people retain their side vision. Some people have only mild central vision loss. In others, it can be more severe.
Early detection and self-care measures may delay vision loss caused by dry macular degeneration.","Dry macular degeneration symptoms usually develop gradually and without pain. They may include: | Visual distortions, such as straight lines seeming bent. | Reduced central vision in one or both eyes. | The need for brighter light when reading or doing close-up work. | Increased difficulty adapting to low light levels, such as when entering a dimly lit restaurant or theater. | Increased blurriness of printed words. | Difficulty recognizing faces. | A well-defined blurry spot or blind spot in the field of vision. | Dry macular degeneration can affect one or both eyes. If only one eye is affected, you may not notice any changes in your vision. This is because your good eye may compensate for the affected eye. And the condition doesn't affect the side vision, so it does not cause total blindness. | Dry macular degeneration is one of two types of age-related macular degeneration. It can progress to wet macular degeneration, which is when blood vessels grow and leak under the retina. The dry type is more common, but it usually progresses slowly over years. The wet type is more likely to cause a relatively sudden change in vision resulting in serious vision loss.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dry-macular-degeneration/symptoms-causes/syc-20350375
Wet macular degeneration,"Wet macular degeneration is an eye condition that causes blurred vision or reduced central vision.

Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS),"Median arcuate ligament syndrome, also called MALS, happens when the band of tissue in the upper belly area presses on the artery that sends blood to the stomach, spleen and liver. This tissue is called the median arcuate ligament. The artery is called the celiac artery.
The median arcuate ligament creates a pathway between the chest and belly area for the body's main blood vessel, called the aorta. Typically, the ligament goes across the aorta. The celiac artery sits just below the arch.
But sometimes, the ligament or arteries may be out of place. The ligament may put pressure on the celiac artery and the network of surrounding nerves, called the celiac plexus. This pressure can cause the symptoms ofMALS. The condition can cause serious stomach pain in some people.
MALScan occur in anyone, even children. Other names forMALSare:

Bipolar disorder,"Bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings. These include emotional highs, also known as mania or hypomania, and lows, also known as depression. Hypomania is less extreme than mania.
When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. When your mood shifts to mania or hypomania, you may feel very excited and happy (euphoric), full of energy or unusually irritable. These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to think clearly.
Episodes of mood swings from depression to mania may occur rarely or multiple times a year. Each bout usually lasts several days. Between episodes, some people have long periods of emotional stability. Others may frequently have mood swings from depression to mania or both depression and mania at the same time.
Although bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, you can manage your mood swings and other symptoms by following a treatment plan. In most cases, healthcare professionals use medicines and talk therapy, also known as psychotherapy, to treat bipolar disorder.","There are several types of bipolar and related disorders: | Bipolar I disorder.You've had at least one manic episode that may come before or after hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In some cases, mania may cause a break from reality. This is called psychosis. | Bipolar II disorder.You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode. But you've never had a manic episode. | Cyclothymia.You've had at least two years — or one year in children and teenagers — of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms. These symptoms are less severe than major depression. | Other types.These types include bipolar and related disorders caused by certain drugs or alcohol, or due to a medical condition, such as Cushing's disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke. | These types may include mania, or hypomania, which is less extreme than mania, and depression. Symptoms can cause changes in mood and behavior that can't be predicted. This can lead to a lot of distress and cause you to have a hard time in life. | Bipolar II disorder is not a milder form of bipolar I disorder. It's a separate diagnosis. While the manic episodes of bipolar I disorder can be severe and dangerous, people with bipolar II disorder can be depressed for longer periods of time. | Bipolar disorder can start at any age, but usually it's diagnosed in the teenage years or early 20s.

Marfan syndrome,"Marfan syndrome is an inherited disorder that affects connective tissue — the fibers that support and anchor your organs and other structures in your body. Marfan syndrome most commonly affects the heart, eyes, blood vessels and skeleton.
People with Marfan syndrome are usually tall and thin with unusually long arms, legs, fingers and toes. The damage caused by Marfan syndrome can be mild or severe. If your aorta — the large blood vessel that carries blood from your heart to the rest of your body — is affected, the condition can become life-threatening.
Treatment usually includes medications to keep your blood pressure low to reduce the strain on your aorta. Regular monitoring to check for damage progression is vital. Many people with Marfan syndrome eventually require preventive surgery to repair the aorta.","The signs and symptoms of Marfan syndrome can vary greatly, even among members of the same family, because the disorder can affect so many different areas of the body. Some people experience only mild effects, but others develop life-threatening complications. | Marfan syndrome features may include: | Tall and slender build | Disproportionately long arms, legs and fingers | A breastbone that protrudes outward or dips inward | A high, arched palate and crowded teeth | Heart murmurs | Extreme nearsightedness | An abnormally curved spine | Flat feet",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/marfan-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20350782
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, often called NAFLD, is a liver problem that affects people who drink little to no alcohol. In NAFLD, too much fat builds up in the liver. It is seen most often in people who are overweight or obese.
NAFLD is becoming more common, especially in Middle Eastern and Western nations as the number of people with obesity rises. It is the most common form of liver disease in the world. NAFLD ranges in severity from hepatic steatosis, called fatty liver, to a more severe form of disease called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
NASH causes the liver to swell and become damaged due to the fat deposits in the liver. NASH may get worse and may lead to serious liver scarring, called cirrhosis, and even liver cancer. This damage is like the damage caused by heavy alcohol use.
A move is currently underway to change the name nonalcoholic fatty liver disease to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Experts also have recommended changing the name nonalcoholic steatohepatitis to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH).","NAFLDoften has no symptoms. When it does, they may include: | Fatigue. | Not feeling well, or malaise. | Pain or discomfort in the upper right belly area. | Possible symptoms ofNASHand cirrhosis, or severe scarring, include: | Itchy skin. | Abdominal swelling, also called ascites (uh-SY-teez). | Shortness of breath. | Swelling of the legs. | Spider-like blood vessels just beneath the skin's surface. | Enlarged spleen. | Red palms. | Yellowing of the skin and eyes, or jaundice.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354567
Breast pain,"Breast pain (mastalgia) can be described as tenderness, throbbing, sharp, stabbing, burning pain or tightness in the breast tissue. The pain may be constant or it may occur only occasionally, and it can occur in men, women and transgender people.
Breast pain can range from mild to severe. It may occur:
In men, breast pain is most commonly caused by a condition called ""gynecomastia"" (guy-nuh-koh-MAS-tee-uh). This refers to an increase in the amount of breast gland tissue that's caused by an imbalance of the hormones estrogen and testosterone. Gynecomastia can affect one or both breasts, sometimes unevenly.
In transgender women, hormone therapy may cause breast pain. In transgender men, breast pain may be caused by the minimal amount of breast tissue that may remain after a mastectomy.
Most times, breast pain signals a noncancerous (benign) breast condition and rarely indicates breast cancer. Unexplained breast pain that doesn't go away after one or two menstrual cycles, or that persists after menopause, or breast pain that doesn't seem to be related to hormone changes needs to be evaluated.","Breast pain can be cyclic or noncyclic. Cyclic means that the pain occurs on a regular pattern. Noncyclic means that the pain is constant, or that there's not a regular pattern. Each type of breast pain has distinct characteristics.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20350423
Mastitis,"Mastitis is swelling and redness, called inflammation, of breast tissue. It sometimes involves an infection. Besides causing swelling and redness, mastitis causes breast pain and warmth. An infection also can cause fever and chills.
Mastitis most often affects people who are breastfeeding. This is called lactation mastitis. But mastitis can happen to people who aren't breastfeeding.
Lactation mastitis can cause you to feel run down, making it hard to care for your baby. Sometimes mastitis causes people to wean their babies earlier than they meant to. But continuing to breastfeed is better for you and your baby. This is true even if you're taking an antibiotic.","Symptoms of mastitis can appear suddenly. They may be in one or both breasts. Symptoms may include: | Breast tenderness or warmth. | Breast swelling. | Thickening of breast tissue, or a breast lump. | Pain or a burning feeling all the time or while breastfeeding. | Skin redness, often in a wedge-shaped pattern. The redness may be harder to see on Black or brown skin. | Feeling ill. | Fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 degrees Celsius) or greater.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mastitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20374829
MCAD deficiency,"Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is an inherited disorder that prevents your body from breaking down certain fats and turning them into energy. Your metabolism involves the processes your body uses to produce energy.MCADdeficiency can cause problems with your metabolism.
If left untreated,MCADdeficiency may lead to severe lack of energy and tiredness, liver disease, coma, and other serious health problems. Also, the level of sugar in your blood can drop dangerously low — a condition called hypoglycemia. Prevention and prompt treatment are essential regardless of blood sugar level. If you haveMCADdeficiency, a sudden episode, called a metabolic crisis, can be caused by common illnesses, high fever, stomach problems or going too long without eating, known as prolonged fasting.
MCADdeficiency is present from birth and is a lifelong condition. In the United States, all states test forMCADdeficiency at birth as part of newborn screening. Many other countries also provide routine newborn screening forMCADdeficiency. IfMCADdeficiency is diagnosed and treated early, the disorder can be well managed through diet and lifestyle.","MCADdeficiency is usually first identified in babies and young children. In rare cases, the disorder is not diagnosed until adulthood. | Symptoms can vary among people with MCAD deficiency. They may include: | Vomiting. | Low or no energy. | Weak feeling. | Low blood sugar. | A sudden severe episode, called a metabolic crisis, can be due to: | Going too long without eating. | Missing meals. | Common infections. | High fever. | Ongoing stomach and digestive problems that may cause vomiting and diarrhea. | Intense exercise.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mcad-deficiency/symptoms-causes/syc-20353745

Medication overuse headaches,"Medication overuse headaches are the result of the long-term use of medicines needed to treat headaches such as migraines. It's OK to take pain relievers for headaches sometimes. But people who take them more than a couple of days a week may get medication overuse headaches, also called rebound headaches.
For people with a headache condition such as migraine, most medicines for pain relief can have this effect. This doesn't seem true for people who have never had a headache condition. But people with a history of headaches who take pain relievers regularly for another condition, such as arthritis, may get medicine overuse headaches.
Medication overuse headaches most often go away after stopping the pain medicine. This can make it challenging to manage pain in the short term. But your healthcare professional can help you find ways to
prevent medication overuse headaches.",Symptoms of medication overuse headaches depend on the type of headache being treated and the medicine used. Medication overuse headaches tend to: | Happen every day or nearly every day.

Melanoma,"Melanoma is a kind of skin cancer that starts in the melanocytes. Melanocytes are cells that make the pigment that gives skin its color. The pigment is called melanin.
Melanoma typically starts on skin that's often exposed to the sun. This includes the skin on the arms, back, face and legs. Melanoma also can form in the eyes. Rarely, it can happen inside the body, such as in the nose or throat.
The exact cause of all melanomas isn't clear. Most melanomas are caused by exposure to ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet light, also called UV light, comes from sunlight or tanning lamps and beds. Limiting exposure toUVlight can help reduce the risk of melanoma.
The risk of melanoma seems to be increasing in people under 40, especially women. Knowing the symptoms of skin cancer can help ensure that cancerous changes are detected and treated before the cancer has spread. Melanoma can be treated successfully if it is found early.","The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are: | A change in an existing mole. | The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on the skin. | Melanoma doesn't always begin as a mole. It also can happen on otherwise healthy skin. | Melanomas symptoms can happen anywhere on the body. Melanomas most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun. This includes the arms, back, face and legs. | Melanomas also can happen in areas that aren't as exposed to the sun. This includes the soles of the feet, palms of the hands and fingernail beds.

Eye melanoma,"Eye melanoma is a kind of eye cancer that starts in cells within the eye that make melanin. Melanin is most often known as the pigment that gives skin its color. But the eyes have cells that make melanin too. Eye melanoma also is called ocular melanoma, intraocular melanoma and uveal melanoma.
Most eye melanomas form in parts of the eye you can't see when looking in a mirror. That makes eye melanoma hard to notice. And eye melanoma typically doesn't cause symptoms at first.
Eye melanoma can be treated. Treatment for small eye melanomas may not cause vision problems. But treatment for large eye melanomas typically leads to some vision loss.","Eye melanoma may not cause any symptoms. When they do happen, signs and symptoms of eye melanoma can include: | Flashes of light or what look like specks of dust in a person's vision. These are sometimes called floaters. | A growing dark spot in the colored part of the eye, called the iris. | A change in the shape of the pupil.

Because symptoms usually get better with rest, muscle weakness can come and go. However, the symptoms tend to progress over time. They usually reach their worst within a few years after the disease begins. | Myasthenia gravis may affect any of the muscles that you can control. Certain muscle groups are more commonly affected than others.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myasthenia-gravis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352036
Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS),"Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a condition in which an atypical protein is found in the blood. The protein is called monoclonal protein or M protein.
This protein is made in the soft, blood-producing tissue in the center of bones. This blood-producing tissue is bone marrow. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance occurs most often in older men.
MGUSusually causes no problems. But sometimes it can lead to more-serious diseases. These include some forms of blood cancer.
People who have high amounts of this protein in the blood need regular checkups. That's so they can get earlier treatment if the condition gets worse. If it doesn't get worse,MGUSdoesn't need treatment.","People with monoclonal gammopathy often don't have symptoms. Some people have a rash or nerve problems, such as numbness or tingling. A blood test for another condition might findMGUSby chance.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mgus/symptoms-causes/syc-20352362

Microscopic colitis,"Microscopic colitis is swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of the large intestine. This large intestine is also called the colon. Microscopic colitis causes symptoms of watery diarrhea.
The condition gets its name from needing to look at colon tissue under a microscope to diagnose it. The tissue appears typical on exam with a colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy.
There are two subtypes of microscopic colitis:
Researchers believe collagenous (kuh-LAYJ-uh-nus) colitis and lymphocytic colitis may be forms of the same condition. Symptoms, testing and treatment are the same for both subtypes.","Symptoms of microscopic colitis include: | Watery diarrhea. | Belly pain, cramps or bloating. | Weight loss. | Nausea. | Not being able to control bowel movements, called fecal incontinence. | The body not having enough water, called dehydration. | The symptoms of microscopic colitis can come and go. At times, symptoms improve on their own.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/microscopic-colitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351478
Blood in urine (hematuria),"It can be scary to see blood in urine, also called hematuria. In many cases, the cause is harmless. But blood in urine also can be a sign of a serious illness.
If you can see the blood, it's called gross hematuria. Blood that can't be seen with the naked eye is called microscopic hematuria. It's such a small amount that it can be seen only under a microscope when a lab tests the urine. Either way, it's important to figure out the reason for the bleeding.
Treatment depends on the cause.","Blood in the urine can look pink, red or cola-colored. Red blood cells cause the urine to change color. It takes only a small amount of blood to turn urine red. | The bleeding often isn't painful. But if blood clots get passed in the urine, that can hurt.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/blood-in-urine/symptoms-causes/syc-20353432
Migraine,"A migraine is a headache that can cause severe throbbing pain or a pulsing sensation, usually on one side of the head. It's often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. Migraine attacks can last for hours to days, and the pain can be so bad that it interferes with your daily activities.
For some people, a warning symptom known as an aura occurs before or with the headache. An aura can include visual disturbances, such as flashes of light or blind spots, or other disturbances, such as tingling on one side of the face or in an arm or leg and difficulty speaking.
Medications can help prevent some migraines and make them less painful. The right medicines, combined with self-help remedies and lifestyle changes, might help.","Migraines, which affect children and teenagers as well as adults, can progress through four stages: prodrome, aura, attack and post-drome. Not everyone who has migraines goes through all stages.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/migraine-headache/symptoms-causes/syc-20360201

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI),"Mild cognitive impairment is the in-between stage between typical thinking skills and dementia. The condition causes memory loss and trouble with language and judgment, but it doesn't affect daily activities.
People with mild cognitive impairment, also known as MCI, may be aware that their memory or mental ability has changed. Family and close friends also may notice changes. But these changes aren't bad enough to impact daily life or affect usual activities.
MCI raises the risk of developing dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease or other brain conditions. But for some people with mild cognitive impairment, symptoms might never get worse or even get better.","Symptoms of mild cognitive impairment, also known as MCI, include trouble with memory, language and judgment. The symptoms are more serious than the memory issues that are expected as people get older. But the symptoms don't affect daily life at work or at home. | The brain, like the rest of the body, changes with age. Many people notice they become more forgetful as they age. It may take longer to think of a word or to recall a person's name. But if concerns with memory go beyond what's expected, the symptoms may be due to mild cognitive impairment. | People with MCI may have symptoms that include: | Forgetting things more often. | Missing appointments or social events. | Losing their train of thought. Or not following the plot of a book or movie. | Trouble following a conversation. | Trouble finding the right word or with language. | Finding it hard to make decisions, finish a task or follow instructions. | Trouble finding their way around places they know well. | Poor judgment. | Changes that are noticed by family and friends. | People with MCI also may experience: | Depression. | Anxiety. | A short temper and aggression. | A lack of interest.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mild-cognitive-impairment/symptoms-causes/syc-20354578

Miscarriage,"Miscarriage is the sudden loss of a pregnancy before the 20th week. About 10% to 20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage. But the actual number is likely higher. This is because many miscarriages happen early on, before people realize they're pregnant.
The term miscarriage might sound as if something was amiss in the carrying of the pregnancy. This is rarely true. Many miscarriages happen because the unborn baby does not develop properly.
Miscarriage is a somewhat common experience — but that doesn't make it any easier. If you've lost a pregnancy, take a step toward emotional healing by learning more. Understand what can cause a miscarriage, what raises the risk and what medical care might be needed.","Most miscarriages happen during the first trimester of pregnancy, which is about the first 13 weeks. | The symptoms can include: | Bleeding from the vagina with or without pain, including light bleeding called spotting. | Pain or cramping in the pelvic area or lower back. | Fluid or tissue passing from the vagina. | Fast heartbeat. | If you have passed tissue from your vagina, place it in a clean container. Then, bring it to your health care professional's office or the hospital. A lab can examine the tissue to check for signs of a miscarriage. | Keep in mind that most pregnant people who have vaginal spotting or bleeding in the first trimester go on to have successful pregnancies. But call your pregnancy care team right away if your bleeding is heavy or happens with cramping pain.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pregnancy-loss-miscarriage/symptoms-causes/syc-20354298
Mitral valve disease,"Mitral valve disease is a problem with the valve located between the left heart chambers. The upper left heart chamber is called the left atrium. The bottom left heart chamber is called the left ventricle.
Mitral valve disease includes:
Treatment for mitral valve disease depends on the severity of the condition and whether it is worsening. Sometimes, surgery is recommended to repair or replace the mitral valve.","Some people with mitral valve disease might not have symptoms for many years, if at all. | Symptoms of mitral valve disease can include: | Fatigue. | Irregular heartbeat. | Shortness of breath.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mitral-valve-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20355107

Mitral valve regurgitation,"Mitral valve regurgitation is the most common type of heart valve disease. In this condition, the valve between the left heart chambers doesn't close fully. Blood leaks backward across the valve. If the leakage is severe, not enough blood moves through the heart or to the rest of the body. Mitral valve regurgitation can make you feel very tired or short of breath.
Other names for mitral valve regurgitation are:
Treatment of mitral valve regurgitation may include regular health checkups, medicines or surgery. You may not need treatment if the condition is mild.
Severe mitral valve regurgitation often requires a catheter procedure or heart surgery to repair or replace the mitral valve. Without proper treatment, severe mitral valve regurgitation can cause heart rhythm problems or heart failure.","Mitral valve regurgitation is often mild and develops slowly. Some people do not have symptoms for many years. | But sometimes, mitral valve regurgitation develops quickly. When this happens, it's called acute mitral valve regurgitation. | Fatigue is a common but nonspecific symptom of mitral valve regurgitation. Other symptoms of mitral valve regurgitation include: | Irregular heartbeat, called an arrhythmia. | Shortness of breath, especially when lying down. | Feelings of a rapid, pounding or fluttering heartbeat, called palpitations. | Swollen feet or ankles.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mitral-valve-regurgitation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350178
Mitral valve stenosis,"Mitral valve stenosis — sometimes called mitral stenosis — is a narrowing of the valve between the two left heart chambers. The narrowed valve reduces or blocks blood flow into the lower left heart chamber. The lower left heart chamber is the heart's main pumping chamber. It also is called the left ventricle.
Mitral valve stenosis can make you tired and short of breath. Other symptoms may include irregular heartbeats, dizziness, chest pain or coughing up blood. Some people don't notice symptoms.
Mitral valve stenosis can be caused by a complication of strep throat called rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever is now rare in the United States.
Treatment for mitral valve stenosis may include medicine or mitral valve repair or replacement surgery. Some people only need regular health checkups. Treatment depends on how severe the valve disease is and whether it's getting worse. Untreated, mitral valve stenosis can lead to serious heart complications.","Mitral valve stenosis usually worsens slowly. You may not have any symptoms, or you may have mild ones for many years. Symptoms of mitral valve stenosis can occur at any age, even during childhood. | Symptoms of mitral valve stenosis include: | Shortness of breath, especially with activity or when you lie down. | Fatigue, especially during increased activity. | Swollen feet or legs. | Pounding, skipping or otherwise irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias. | Dizziness or fainting. | Fluid buildup in the lungs. | Chest discomfort or chest pain. | Coughing up blood. | Mitral valve stenosis symptoms may appear or get worse when the heart rate increases, such as during exercise.

Mittelschmerz,"Mittelschmerz is one-sided, lower abdominal pain associated with ovulation. German for ""middle pain,"" mittelschmerz occurs midway through a menstrual cycle — about 14 days before your next menstrual period.
In most cases, mittelschmerz doesn't require medical attention. For minor mittelschmerz discomfort, over-the-counter pain relievers and home remedies are often effective. If your mittelschmerz pain is troublesome, your doctor may prescribe an oral contraceptive to stop ovulation and prevent midcycle pain.","Mittelschmerz pain usually lasts a few minutes to a few hours, but it may continue for as long as a day or two. Pain from mittelschmerz may be: | On one side of your lower abdomen | Dull and achy, similar to menstrual cramps | Sharp and sudden | Accompanied by slight vaginal bleeding or discharge | Rarely, severe | Mittelschmerz pain occurs on the side of the ovary that's releasing an egg (ovulating). The pain may switch sides every other month, or you may feel pain on the same side for several months. | Keep track of your menstrual cycle for several months and note when you feel lower abdominal pain.

Molar pregnancy,"A molar pregnancy is a rare complication of pregnancy. It involves unusual growth of cells called trophoblasts. These cells typically become the organ that feeds a growing fetus. That organ also is known as the placenta.
There are two types of molar pregnancy — complete molar pregnancy and partial molar pregnancy. In a complete molar pregnancy, the placental tissue swells and appears to form fluid-filled cysts. There is no fetus.
In a partial molar pregnancy, the placenta might have both regular and irregular tissue. There may be a fetus, but the fetus can't survive. The fetus usually is miscarried early in the pregnancy.
A molar pregnancy can have serious complications, including a rare form of cancer. A molar pregnancy requires early treatment.","A molar pregnancy may seem like a regular pregnancy at first. But most molar pregnancies cause symptoms that can include: | Dark brown to bright red bleeding from the vagina during the first three months | Severe nausea and vomiting | Sometimes grapelike cysts that pass from the vagina | Pelvic pressure or pain | Because of improved ways of detecting a molar pregnancy, most are found in the first trimester. If it is not found in the first three months, symptoms of a molar pregnancy might include: | A uterus growing quickly and being too large early in the pregnancy | Preeclampsia — a condition that causes high blood pressure and protein in the urine — before 20 weeks of pregnancy | Ovarian cysts | Overactive thyroid, also known as hyperthyroidism",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/molar-pregnancy/symptoms-causes/syc-20375175

Moles,"Moles, also known as nevi, are a common type of skin growth. They often appear as small, dark brown spots that are caused by clusters of pigment-forming cells called melanocytes. Most people have 10 to 45 moles that appear during childhood and the teenage years. How these moles look may change over time. They also may fade over time.
Most moles are harmless. Rarely, they become cancerous. Being aware of changes in your moles and other pigmented patches is important to finding skin cancer, especially malignant melanoma.","The typical mole is a small brown spot. But moles come in different colors, shapes and sizes: | Color and texture.Moles can be brown, tan, black, blue, red or pink. They can be smooth, wrinkled, flat or raised. They may have hair growing from them. | Shape.Most moles are oval or round. | Size.Moles are typically less than 1/4 inch (about 6 mm) in diameter — the size of a pencil eraser. Those present at birth, known as congenital nevi, can be bigger and cover part of the face, trunk or a limb. | Moles can grow anywhere on your body, including your scalp and armpits, as well as under your nails and between your fingers and toes. Most people have 10 to 45 moles. Many of these moles occur by age 40. Moles may change or fade away over time. They may become darker and larger with hormonal changes that occur during the teenage years and while pregnant. | Clusters of brown spots around the eyes, cheeks and nose are dermatoses papulosa nigra — a type of seborrheic keratosis that is noncancerous and appears as waxy brown, black or tan growths. They aren't clusters of pigment-forming cells, known as nevi. Dermatoses papulosa nigra are more common among Black women.

Mood disorders,"Mood disorders, such as depression and bipolar disorder, affect people emotionally. If you have depression, you may constantly feel sad. You also may be anxious. If you have bipolar disorder, you'll likely have extreme mood swings. Your feelings may range from being very sad, empty or cranky to being very happy — going back and forth between each mood. Mood disorders are more common in women.
Having a mood disorder may raise your risk of suicide. This risk is higher if the mood disorder is serious and you also have problems with alcohol or drugs.
If you're thinking about suicide, contact a hotline for help. In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. It's available 24 hours a day, every day.

Morning sickness,"Morning sickness is feeling like throwing up, also called nausea, and throwing up, also called vomiting, that occurs during pregnancy. Despite its name, morning sickness can strike at any time of the day or night.
Many people have morning sickness, especially during the first three months of pregnancy. But some people have morning sickness all through pregnancy. Home remedies, such as snacking during the day and sipping ginger ale or taking medicine you can buy without a prescription, might help relieve nausea.
Rarely, morning sickness is so bad that it turns into hyperemesis gravidarum. This is when the nausea and vomiting cause serious fluid loss or loss of more than 5% of pre-pregnancy body weight. Hyperemesis gravidarum might require going to a hospital for treatment.","Nausea, with or without vomiting, is common in pregnancy. Morning sickness is often brought on by smelling certain odors or eating certain foods. | Morning sickness is most common during the first three months of pregnancy.

Morphea,"Morphea (mor-FEE-uh) is a rare condition that causes painless, discolored patches on your skin.
Typically, the skin changes appear on the belly, chest or back. But they might also appear on your face, arms and legs. Over time the patches may become firm, dry and smooth. Morphea tends to affect only the outer layers of your skin. But some forms of the condition also affect deeper tissues and may restrict movement in the joints.
Morphea usually improves on its own over time, though recurrences are common. In the meantime, medications and therapies are available to help treat the skin discoloration and other effects.","Signs and symptoms of morphea vary depending on the type and stage of the condition. They include: | Reddish or purplish oval patches of skin, often on the belly, chest or back | Patches that gradually develop a lighter or whitish center | Linear patches, especially on the arms or legs and possibly the forehead or scalp | A gradual change in the affected skin, which becomes firm, thickened, dry and shiny | Morphea affects the skin and underlying tissue and sometimes bone.

Morton's neuroma,"Morton's neuroma is a painful condition that affects the ball of your foot, most commonly the area between your third and fourth toes. Morton's neuroma may feel as if you are standing on a pebble in your shoe or on a fold in your sock.
Morton's neuroma involves a thickening of the tissue around one of the nerves leading to your toes. This can cause a sharp, burning pain in the ball of your foot. You may have stinging, burning or numbness in the affected toes.
High-heeled or tight shoes have been linked to the development of Morton's neuroma. Many people experience relief by switching to lower heeled shoes with wider toe boxes. Sometimes corticosteroid injections or surgery may be necessary.","Typically, there's no outward sign of this condition, such as a lump. Instead, you may experience the following symptoms: | A feeling as if you're standing on a pebble in your shoe | A burning pain in the ball of your foot that may radiate into your toes | Tingling or numbness in your toes | In addition to these symptoms, you may find that removing your shoe and rubbing your foot often helps to relieve the pain.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mortons-neuroma/symptoms-causes/syc-20351935

Movement disorders,"Movement disorders are a group of nervous system conditions that affect movement. They can cause either increased movements or reduced or slow movements. These movements may be under the person's control, known as voluntary. Or the movements may not be under the person's control, known as involuntary.
There are many types of movement disorders that cause different symptoms. For example, dystonia causes muscle contractions that lead to twisting of the body. Another movement disorder called chorea causes brief periods of quick involuntary movements that happen over and over. Parkinsonism causes slowness of movement with stiffness, tremors or loss of balance.
Treatments may be available to help manage the symptoms of movement disorders. Depending on the type of movement disorder, medicines, therapies or surgeries may be available. If a condition causes the movement disorder, treating the condition may help improve symptoms.","Symptoms of movement disorders vary depending on the type of the disorder. Common types of movement disorders and their symptoms include: | Ataxia.Ataxia affects the part of the brain that controls coordinated movement. Ataxia may cause clumsy movements of the arms and legs, and a loss of balance. Ataxia also can change a person's speech and cause other symptoms. There are many causes of ataxia, including genetic and degenerative conditions. Ataxia also may be caused by an infection or another treatable condition. | Chorea.Chorea causes brief, irregular, somewhat rapid, involuntary movements that happen over and over. The movements typically involve the face, mouth, trunk, arm and leg. Chorea can look like exaggerated fidgeting.The most common genetic chorea is Huntington's disease. This disease is passed down from a parent and gets worse over time. It can be confirmed with genetic testing. Huntington's disease has three types of symptoms. They include movements that can't be controlled, trouble with thinking and mental health conditions. | Dystonia.This condition involves involuntary muscle contractions that cause twisting, irregular postures, or movements that occur again and again. Dystonia may affect the entire body or one part of the body.The most common type of dystonia in adults is cervical dystonia. In cervical dystonia, the neck muscles contract involuntarily. This causes the head to pull to one side or to tilt forward or backward. The head also may shake, known as a tremor. | Functional movement disorder.This condition may look like any of the movement disorders. But it's not caused by a disease of the nervous system, also known as a neurological disease. Functional movement disorders are treatable. | Multiple system atrophy.This rare condition affects many brain systems and gets worse over time. Multiple system atrophy causes a movement disorder, such as ataxia or parkinsonism. It also can cause low blood pressure, bladder symptoms and acting out dreams. | Myoclonus.Myoclonus are very quick jerks of a muscle. | Parkinson's disease.Parkinson's disease causes tremors, muscle stiffness, slow or decreased movement, or loss of balance. It also can cause symptoms not related to movement. These symptoms include a reduced sense of smell, constipation, acting out dreams and a decline in thinking skills. Parkinson's disease slowly gets worse over time. | Parkinsonism.Parkinsonism is a general term for slowness of movement along with stiffness, tremors or loss of balance. There are many different causes. Parkinson's disease and certain dopamine blocking medicines are the most common causes. Other causes include degenerative disorders such as multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy. Stroke or repeated head trauma also can cause parkinsonism. | Progressive supranuclear palsy.This is a rare nervous system condition that causes problems with walking, balance and eye movements. It may resemble Parkinson's disease but is a distinct condition. | Restless legs syndrome.This movement disorder causes aching, itching, or creeping feelings in the legs while relaxing or lying down. The feeling often goes away with movement. | Tardive dyskinesia.This neurological condition is caused by long-term use of certain medicines used to treat mental health conditions, called neuroleptic medicines. It also can be caused by a common gastrointestinal medicine called metoclopramide (Reglan, Gimoti). Tardive dyskinesia causes involuntary movements that occur over and over. Symptoms include grimacing, eye blinking and other movements. | Tourette syndrome.This is a neurological condition associated with repetitive movements and vocal sounds called tics. Tics are voluntary movements, but they're caused by an involuntary urge to make the movements. Tourette syndrome starts between childhood and teenage years. | Tremor.This movement disorder causes rhythmic shaking of parts of the body, such as the hands, head or other body parts. The most common type is essential tremor.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/movement-disorders/symptoms-causes/syc-20363893
Moyamoya disease,"Moyamoya disease is a rare blood vessel condition in which the carotid artery in the skull becomes blocked or narrowed. The carotid artery is a major artery that brings blood to the brain. When it's blocked, blood flow to the brain is reduced. Tiny blood vessels then form at the base of the brain to supply the brain with blood.
The condition may cause a ministroke, known as atransient ischemic attack (TIA), or astroke. It also can cause bleeding in the brain. Moyamoya disease can affect how well the brain functions and can cause cognitive and developmental delays or disability.
Moyamoya disease most commonly affects children. However, adults may have the condition as well. Moyamoya disease is found all over the world. But it's more common in East Asian countries, especially Korea, Japan and China. This may be due to certain genetic factors in those populations.","Moyamoya disease may happen at any age. But symptoms are most common in children between ages 5 and 10 and in adults between ages 30 and 50. Spotting symptoms early is very important to prevent complications such as a stroke. | Moyamoya disease causes different symptoms in adults and children. In children, the first symptom is usually a stroke or recurrent transient ischemic attack, also called TIA. Adults may experience these symptoms, as well. But adults also may experience bleeding in the brain, known as a hemorrhagic stroke. The bleeding happens because of the way blood vessels in the brain formed. | Symptoms of moyamoya disease related to reduced blood flow to the brain include: | Headache. | Seizures. | Weakness, numbness or paralysis in the face, arm or leg. This is typically on one side of the body. | Vision problems. | Trouble speaking or understanding others, known as aphasia. | Cognitive or developmental delays. | Involuntary movements. | These symptoms can be triggered by exercise, crying, coughing, straining or a fever. | See your healthcare professional if you have any of the symptoms of moyamoya disease. Early detection and treatment can help prevent a stroke and serious complications.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/moyamoya-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20355586
Multiple sclerosis,"Multiple sclerosis is a disease that causes breakdown of the protective covering of nerves. Multiple sclerosis can cause numbness, weakness, trouble walking, vision changes and other symptoms. It's also known as MS.
In MS, the immune system attacks the protective sheath that covers nerve fibers, known as myelin. This interrupts communication between the brain and the rest of the body. Eventually, the disease can cause permanent damage of the nerve fibers.
Symptoms of MS depend on the person, the location of damage in the nervous system and how bad the damage is to the nerve fibers. Some people lose the ability to walk on their own or move at all. Others may have long periods between attacks without any new symptoms, called remission. The course of the disease varies depending on the type of MS.
There's no cure for multiple sclerosis. However, there are treatments to help speed the recovery from attacks, modify the course of the disease and manage symptoms.","Multiple sclerosis symptoms vary depending on the person. Symptoms may change over the course of the disease depending on which nerve fibers are affected. | Common symptoms include: | Numbness or tingling. | Electric-shock sensations that happen with certain neck movements, especially bending the neck forward.

Multiple system atrophy,"Multiple system atrophy, also called MSA, causes people to lose coordination and balance or become slow and stiff. It also causes changes in speech and loss of control of other bodily functions.
MSA is a rare condition. It sometimes shares symptoms with Parkinson's disease, including slow movement, rigid muscles and poor balance.
Treatment includes medicines and lifestyle changes to help manage symptoms, but there is no cure. The condition gets worse over time and eventually leads to death.
In the past, this condition has been called Shy-Drager syndrome, olivopontocerebellar atrophy or striatonigral degeneration.","Multiple system atrophy (MSA) symptoms affect many parts of the body. Symptoms start in adulthood, usually in the 50s or 60s. | There are two types of MSA: parkinsonian and cerebellar. The type depends on the symptoms a person has when diagnosed.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-system-atrophy/symptoms-causes/syc-20356153
Kawasaki disease,"Kawasaki disease causes swelling, called inflammation, in the walls of small to medium-sized blood vessels that carry blood throughout the body. Kawasaki disease most often affects the heart arteries in children. Those arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart.
Kawasaki disease  is sometimes called mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. That's because it also causes swelling in glands, called lymph nodes, and mucous membranes inside the mouth, nose, eyes and throat.
Children with Kawasaki disease might have high fever, swollen hands and feet with skin peeling, and red eyes and tongue. But Kawasaki disease is often treatable. With early treatment, most children get better and have no long-lasting problems.","Symptoms of Kawasaki disease include a fever greater than 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius) for five or more days. And the child  has at least four of the following symptoms. | A rash on the main part of the body or in the genital area. | An enlarged lymph node in the neck. | Very red eyes without a thick discharge. | Red, dry, cracked lips and a red, swollen tongue. | Swollen, red skin on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Later the skin on fingers and toes peels. | The symptoms might not happen at the same time. Let your child's healthcare professional know about a symptom that has gone away. | Other symptoms might include: | Belly pain. | Diarrhea. | Fussiness. | Joint pain. | Vomiting. | Some children get a high fever for five or more days but have fewer than four of the symptoms needed for a diagnosis of Kawasaki disease. They might have what's called incomplete Kawasaki disease. Children with incomplete Kawasaki disease are still at risk of damage to the heart arteries. They still need treatment within 10 days of when symptoms appear. | Kawasaki disease can have symptoms like those of a condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. The syndrome happens in children with COVID-19.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kawasaki-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354598
"Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1)","Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) is a rare condition. It mainly causes tumors in the glands that make and release hormones. These are called the endocrine glands. The condition also can cause tumors in the small intestine and stomach. Another name for MEN 1 is Wermer's syndrome.
The endocrine gland tumors that form due to MEN 1 usually are not cancer. Most often, the tumors grow on the parathyroid glands, the pancreas and the pituitary gland. Some glands affected by MEN 1 also may release too many hormones. That can lead to other health concerns.
The extra hormones of MEN 1 can cause many symptoms. These symptoms may include tiredness, bone pain, broken bones, kidney stones, and ulcers in the stomach or intestines.
MEN 1 can't be cured. But regular testing can detect health concerns, and healthcare professionals can provide treatment as needed.
MEN 1 is an inherited condition. That means people who have a genetic change that causes MEN 1 can pass it on to their children.","Symptoms of multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) can include the following: | Tiredness. | Bone pain or broken bones. | Kidney stones. | Ulcers in the stomach or intestines. | Stomach pain. | Muscle weakness. | Depression. | Acid reflux. | Frequent diarrhea. | Symptoms are caused by the release of too many hormones in the body.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/men-1/symptoms-causes/syc-20353064
Multiple myeloma,"Multiple myeloma is a cancer that forms in a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell. Healthy plasma cells help fight infections by making proteins called antibodies. Antibodies find and attack germs.
In multiple myeloma, cancerous plasma cells build up in bone marrow. The bone marrow is the soft matter inside bones where blood cells are made. In the bone marrow, the cancer cells crowd out healthy blood cells. Rather than make helpful antibodies, the cancer cells make proteins that don't work right. This leads to complications of multiple myeloma.
Multiple myeloma treatment isn't always needed right away. If the multiple myeloma is slow growing and isn't causing symptoms, close watching might be the first step. For people with multiple myeloma who need treatment, there are a number of ways to help control the disease.","Early in multiple myeloma, there might be no symptoms. When signs and symptoms happen, they can include: | Bone pain, especially in the spine, chest or hips. | Nausea. | Constipation. | Loss of appetite. | Mental fogginess or confusion. | Tiredness. | Infections. | Weight loss. | Weakness. | Thirst. | Needing to urinate often.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-myeloma/symptoms-causes/syc-20353378
Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and COVID-19,"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a group of symptoms linked to swollen, called inflamed, organs or tissues. People withMIS-Cneed care in the hospital.
MIS-Cwas first detected in April 2020.MIS-Cis currently linked to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Experts are still studying the cause ofMIS-Cand risk factors for getting it.
Most children who catch theCOVID-19virus have only a mild illness. But in children withMIS-C, after infection with theCOVID-19virus, the blood vessels, digestive system, skin or eyes become swollen and irritated.
MIS-Cis rare. It most often happens within 2 months after havingCOVID-19. The child may have had a known infection. Or a close contact may have a confirmed infection.
Most children who haveMIS-Ceventually get better with medical care. But some kids quickly get worse.MIS-Ccan cause life-threatening illness or death.",,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mis-c-in-kids-covid-19/symptoms-causes/syc-20502550
Mumps,,,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mumps/symptoms-causes/syc-20375361
Muscle cramp,"A muscle cramp is a sudden, unexpected tightening of one or more muscles. Sometimes called a charley horse, a muscle cramp can be very painful. Exercising or working hard, especially in heat, can lead to muscle cramps. Some medicines and illnesses also might cause muscle cramps.
Muscle cramps aren't usually harmful. Self-care measures can treat most muscle cramps.","Muscle cramps occur mostly in leg muscles, most often in the calf. Cramps usually last for seconds to minutes. After the cramp eases, the area might be sore for hours or days.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/muscle-cramp/symptoms-causes/syc-20350820
Muscle strains,"A muscle strain is an injury to a muscle or a tendon — the fibrous tissue that connects muscles to bones. Minor injuries may only overstretch a muscle or tendon, while more severe injuries may involve partial or complete tears in these tissues.
Sometimes called pulled muscles, strains commonly occur in the lower back and in the muscles at the back of the thigh (hamstrings).
The difference between a strain and a sprain is that a strain involves an injury to a muscle or to the band of tissue that attaches a muscle to a bone, while a sprain injures the bands of tissue that connect two bones together.
Initial treatment includes rest, ice, compression and elevation. Mild strains can be successfully treated at home. Severe strains sometimes require surgical repair.","Signs and symptoms will vary, depending on the severity of the injury, and may include: | Pain or tenderness | Redness or bruising | Limited motion | Muscle spasms | Swelling | Muscle weakness",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/muscle-strains/symptoms-causes/syc-20450507
Myelofibrosis,"Myelofibrosis is an uncommon type of bone marrow cancer that disrupts your body's normal production of blood cells.
Myelofibrosis causes extensive scarring in your bone marrow, leading to severe anemia that can cause weakness and fatigue. Bone marrow scarring can also cause you to have a low number of blood-clotting cells called platelets, which increases the risk of bleeding. Myelofibrosis often causes an enlarged spleen.
Myelofibrosis is considered to be a chronic leukemia — a cancer that affects the blood-forming tissues in the body. Myelofibrosis belongs to a group of diseases called myeloproliferative disorders.
Myelofibrosis can happen on its own (primary myelofibrosis) or it can develop from another bone marrow disorder (secondary myelofibrosis).
Some people with myelofibrosis have no symptoms and might not need treatment right away. Others with more-serious forms of the disease might need aggressive treatments right away. Treatment for myelofibrosis, which focuses on relieving symptoms, can involve a variety of options.","Myelofibrosis usually develops slowly. In its very early stages, many people don't experience signs or symptoms. | As disruption of normal blood cell production increases, signs and symptoms may include: | Feeling tired, weak or short of breath, usually because of anemia | Pain or fullness below your ribs on the left side, due to an enlarged spleen | Easy bruising | Easy bleeding | Excessive sweating during sleep (night sweats) | Fever | Bone pain",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myelofibrosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355057

Myocardial ischemia,,,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myocardial-ischemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20375417
Myocarditis,"Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle, called the myocardium. The condition can reduce the heart's ability to pump blood. Myocarditis can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and rapid or irregular heartbeats.
Infection with a virus is one cause of myocarditis. Sometimes myocarditis is caused by a medicine reaction or a condition that causes inflammation throughout the body.
Severe myocarditis weakens the heart so that the rest of the body doesn't get enough blood. Clots can form in the heart, leading to a stroke or heart attack.
Treatment for myocarditis may include medicines, procedures or surgeries.","Some people with early myocarditis don't have symptoms. Others have mild symptoms. | Common myocarditis symptoms include: | Chest pain. | Fatigue. | Swelling of the legs, ankles and feet. | Rapid or irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias. | Shortness of breath, at rest or during activity. | Lightheadedness or feeling like you might faint. | Flu-like symptoms such as headache, body aches, joint pain, fever or sore throat. | Sometimes, myocarditis symptoms are like symptoms of a heart attack. If you are having unexplained chest pain and shortness of breath, seek emergency medical help.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myocarditis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352539
Myoclonus,"Myoclonus refers to a quick jerking movement that you can't control. Hiccups are a form of myoclonus, as are the sudden jerks or ""sleep starts"" that you may feel just before falling asleep. These forms of myoclonus occur in healthy people and usually aren't serious.
Other forms of myoclonus may occur because of a nervous system disorder, such as epilepsy, a metabolic condition, or a reaction to a medicine.
Treating whatever condition causes myoclonus can help control symptoms. Sometimes the cause of myoclonus is unknown or can't be specifically treated. In these cases, the goal of treatment is to reduce the effects of myoclonus on quality of life.","People with myoclonus often describe their symptoms as jerks, shakes or spasms that are: | Sudden | Brief | Involuntary | Shock-like | Variable in intensity and frequency | Occurring in one part of the body or all over the body | Sometimes severe enough to interfere with eating, speaking or walking",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myoclonus/symptoms-causes/syc-20350459
Myofascial pain syndrome,"Myofascial pain syndrome is a long-term pain condition. It involves some muscles and the thin cover of tissue that holds muscles in place, called fascia. Pressure on these areas, called trigger points, causes pain.
Sometimes, the pain is felt in other parts of the body. This is called referred pain. The pain often is felt as shoulder pain, back pain, tension headaches and face pain.
This syndrome can happen after a muscle has been tensed over and over. Repeated motions used in jobs or hobbies can be the cause. So can stress-related muscle tension, poor posture and weak muscles. In some cases, the cause of myofascial pain is unknown.
Almost everyone has felt muscle tension pain. But the pain of myofascial pain syndrome doesn't go away. Treatment options include exercise, massage, physical therapy and shots in the trigger points. Pain medicines and finding ways to relax also can help.","Symptoms of myofascial pain syndrome may include: | Deep, aching pain in a muscle. | Pain that doesn't go away or gets worse. | A tender knot in a muscle. | Trouble sleeping due to pain. | A general feeling of being not well, called malaise. | Tiredness.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myofascial-pain-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20375444
Nearsightedness,"Nearsightedness is a common vision condition in which close objects look clear but far objects look blurry. The medical term for nearsightedness is myopia. Myopia happens when the shape of the eye — or the shape of certain parts of the eye — causes light rays to bend or refract. Light rays that should be focused on nerve tissues at the back of the eye, called the retina, are focused in front of the retina instead.
Nearsightedness usually develops during childhood and adolescence. Typically, it becomes more stable between the ages of 20 and 40. It tends to run in families.
A basic eye exam can confirm nearsightedness. You can correct the blurry vision with eyeglasses, contact lenses or refractive surgery.","Nearsightedness symptoms may include: | Blurry vision when looking at distant objects. | The need to squint or partially close the eyelids to see clearly. | Headaches. | Eyestrain. | School-age children may have difficulty seeing things on whiteboards or screen projections in the classroom. Younger children might not express difficulty seeing, but they may have the following behaviors that suggest difficulty seeing: | Constant squinting. | Seeming to not be aware of distant objects. | Blinking often. | Rubbing the eyes often. | Sitting close to the television or moving screens closer to the face. | Adults with nearsightedness may notice difficulty reading street signs or signs in stores. Some people may experience blurry vision in dim light, as with nighttime driving, even if they see clearly in daylight. This condition is called night myopia.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nearsightedness/symptoms-causes/syc-20375556
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, often called NAFLD, is a liver problem that affects people who drink little to no alcohol. In NAFLD, too much fat builds up in the liver. It is seen most often in people who are overweight or obese.
NAFLD is becoming more common, especially in Middle Eastern and Western nations as the number of people with obesity rises. It is the most common form of liver disease in the world. NAFLD ranges in severity from hepatic steatosis, called fatty liver, to a more severe form of disease called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
NASH causes the liver to swell and become damaged due to the fat deposits in the liver. NASH may get worse and may lead to serious liver scarring, called cirrhosis, and even liver cancer. This damage is like the damage caused by heavy alcohol use.
A move is currently underway to change the name nonalcoholic fatty liver disease to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Experts also have recommended changing the name nonalcoholic steatohepatitis to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH).","NAFLDoften has no symptoms. When it does, they may include: | Fatigue. | Not feeling well, or malaise. | Pain or discomfort in the upper right belly area. | Possible symptoms ofNASHand cirrhosis, or severe scarring, include: | Itchy skin. | Abdominal swelling, also called ascites (uh-SY-teez). | Shortness of breath. | Swelling of the legs. | Spider-like blood vessels just beneath the skin's surface. | Enlarged spleen. | Red palms. | Yellowing of the skin and eyes, or jaundice.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354567
Nail fungus,"Nail fungus is a common infection of the nail. It begins as a white or yellow-brown spot under the tip of your fingernail or toenail. As the fungal infection goes deeper, the nail may discolor, thicken and crumble at the edge. Nail fungus can affect several nails.
If your condition is mild and not bothering you, you may not need treatment. If your nail fungus is painful and has caused thickened nails, self-care steps and medications may help. But even if treatment is successful, nail fungus often comes back.
Nail fungus is also called onychomycosis (on-ih-koh-my-KOH-sis). When fungus infects the areas between your toes and the skin of your feet, it's called athlete's foot (tinea pedis).","Symptoms of nail fungus include a nail or nails that are: | Thickened | Discolored | Brittle, crumbly or ragged | Misshapen | Separated from the nail bed | Smelly | Nail fungus can affect fingernails, but it's more common in toenails.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nail-fungus/symptoms-causes/syc-20353294
Narcissistic personality disorder,"Narcissistic personality disorder is a mental health condition in which people have an unreasonably high sense of their own importance. They need and seek too much attention and want people to admire them. People with this disorder may lack the ability to understand or care about the feelings of others. But behind this mask of extreme confidence, they are not sure of their self-worth and are easily upset by the slightest criticism.
A narcissistic personality disorder causes problems in many areas of life, such as relationships, work, school or financial matters. People with narcissistic personality disorder may be generally unhappy and disappointed when they're not given the special favors or admiration that they believe they deserve. They may find their relationships troubled and unfulfilling, and other people may not enjoy being around them.
Treatment for narcissistic personality disorder centers around talk therapy, also called psychotherapy.
Narcissistic personality disorder affects more males than females, and it often begins in the teens or early adulthood. Some children may show traits of narcissism, but this is often typical for their age and doesn't mean they'll go on to develop narcissistic personality disorder.","Symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder and how severe they are can vary. People with the disorder can: | Have an unreasonably high sense of self-importance and require constant, excessive admiration. | Feel that they deserve privileges and special treatment. | Expect to be recognized as superior even without achievements. | Make achievements and talents seem bigger than they are. | Be preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, brilliance, beauty or the perfect mate. | Believe they are superior to others and can only spend time with or be understood by equally special people. | Be critical of and look down on people they feel are not important. | Expect special favors and expect other people to do what they want without questioning them. | Take advantage of others to get what they want. | Have an inability or unwillingness to recognize the needs and feelings of others. | Be envious of others and believe others envy them. | Behave in an arrogant way, brag a lot and come across as conceited. | Insist on having the best of everything — for instance, the best car or office. | At the same time, people with narcissistic personality disorder have trouble handling anything they view as criticism. They can: | Become impatient or angry when they don't receive special recognition or treatment. | Have major problems interacting with others and easily feel slighted. | React with rage or contempt and try to belittle other people to make themselves appear superior. | Have difficulty managing their emotions and behavior. | Experience major problems dealing with stress and adapting to change. | Withdraw from or avoid situations in which they might fail. | Feel depressed and moody because they fall short of perfection. | Have secret feelings of insecurity, shame, humiliation and fear of being exposed as a failure.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20366662
Narcolepsy,"Narcolepsy is a condition that makes people very sleepy during the day and can cause them to fall asleep suddenly. Some people also have other symptoms, such as muscle weakness when they feel strong emotions.
The symptoms can have serious effects on daily life. People with narcolepsy have trouble staying awake for long periods of time. When narcolepsy causes a sudden loss of muscle tone, it is known as cataplexy (KAT-uh-plek-see). This can be triggered by a strong emotion, especially one that causes laughter.
Narcolepsy is divided into two types. Most people with type 1 narcolepsy have cataplexy. Most people with type 2 narcolepsy don't have cataplexy.
Narcolepsy is a lifelong condition and does not have a cure. However, medicines and lifestyle changes can help manage the symptoms. Support from family, friends, employers and teachers can help people cope with the condition.","The symptoms of narcolepsy may get worse during the first few years. Then they continue for life. Symptoms include: | Extreme daytime sleepiness.Daytime sleepiness is the first symptom to appear, and the sleepiness makes it hard to focus and function. People with narcolepsy feel less alert and focused during the day. They also fall asleep without warning. Sleep can happen anywhere and at any time. It may happen when they are bored or while doing a task. For example, people with narcolepsy can suddenly fall asleep while working or talking with friends. It can be especially dangerous to fall asleep while driving. Sleep may last only a few minutes or up to a half-hour. After waking, people with narcolepsy feel refreshed but get sleepy again. | Automatic behaviors.Some people with narcolepsy continue doing a task when they fall asleep briefly. For example, they may fall asleep while writing, typing or driving. They might continue to perform that task while asleep. After waking, they can't remember what they did, and they probably didn't do it well. | Sudden loss of muscle tone.This condition is called cataplexy. It can cause slurred speech or complete weakness of most muscles for up to a few minutes. It's triggered by intense emotions — often positive emotions. Laughter or excitement may cause sudden muscle weakness. But sometimes fear, surprise or anger can cause the loss of muscle tone. For example, when you laugh, your head may drop without your control. Or your knees may suddenly lose strength, causing you to fall. Some people with narcolepsy experience only one or two episodes of cataplexy a year. Others have several episodes a day. Not everyone with narcolepsy has these symptoms. | Sleep paralysis.People with narcolepsy may experience sleep paralysis. During sleep paralysis, the person can't move or speak while falling asleep or upon waking. The paralysis is usually brief — lasting a few seconds or minutes. But it can be scary. You may be aware of it happening and can recall it afterward. Not everyone with sleep paralysis has narcolepsy. | Hallucinations.Sometimes people see things that aren't there during sleep paralysis. Hallucinations also may happen in bed without sleep paralysis. These are called hypnagogic hallucinations if they happen as you fall asleep. They're called hypnopompic hallucinations if they happen upon waking. For example, the person might think they see a stranger in the bedroom who isn't there. These hallucinations may be vivid and frightening because you may not be fully asleep when you begin dreaming. | Changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.REM sleep is when most dreaming happens. Typically, people enter REM sleep 60 to 90 minutes after falling asleep. But people with narcolepsy often move more quickly to REM sleep. They tend to enter REM sleep within 15 minutes of falling asleep. REM sleep also can happen at any time of the day.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcolepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20375497
Nasal and paranasal tumors,"Nasal and paranasal tumors are growths that begin in and around the passageway within the nose. Nasal tumors begin in the main passageway within the nose, called the nasal cavity. Paranasal tumors begin in air-filled chambers around the nose, called the paranasal sinuses.
Some nasal and paranasal tumors aren't cancerous. These noncancerous tumors also are called benign tumors. They can grow to block the flow of air through the nose.
Other nasal and paranasal tumors are cancers. Cancerous tumors also are called malignant tumors. They can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, the cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body.
Several types of nasal and paranasal tumors exist. The type of tumor you have helps determine the best treatment for you.",Signs and symptoms of nasal and paranasal tumors can include: | Difficulty breathing through the nose. | Frequent headaches. | Loss of the sense of smell. | Nosebleeds. | Discharge from the nose. | Facial swelling or pain. | Watery eyes. | A sore on the roof of the mouth. | Vision problems. | A lump in the neck. | Difficulty opening the mouth.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nasal-paranasal-tumors/symptoms-causes/syc-20354136
Nasal polyps,"Nasal polyps are painless growths inside the nose or the hollow areas inside the bones of the face, also known as sinuses. Nasal polyps aren't cancer.
Small nasal polyps might not cause symptoms. Larger growths or groups of nasal polyps can block the nose. They can lead to breathing problems, not being able to smell and infections.
Nasal polyps can affect anyone. But they're more common in young and middle-aged adults. Medicines can often shrink nasal polyps or get rid of them. But surgery might be needed to remove them. Even after treatment, nasal polyps often come back.","Nasal polyps are linked to irritation and swelling, also called inflammation, of the inside of the nose and sinuses that lasts more than 12 weeks. This is known as chronic sinusitis. But it's possible to have chronic sinusitis without getting nasal polyps. | People who have small nasal polyps might not know they have them. But having more than one polyp or having a large polyp can block the nose. | Common symptoms of chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps include: | Runny, stuffy nose. | Mucus running down the throat, also known as postnasal drip. | Not being able to smell. | Not being able to taste. | Facial pain or headache. | Pain in the teeth. | A sense of pressure over the forehead and face. | Snoring.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nasal-polyps/symptoms-causes/syc-20351888
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is cancer that starts as a growth of cells in the nasopharynx. The nasopharynx is the upper part of the throat. It sits behind the nose.
Nasopharyngeal (nay-zoh-fuh-RIN-jee-ul) carcinoma is rare in the United States. It happens much more often in other parts of the world, mainly Southeast Asia.
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is hard to find early. That's most likely because the nasopharynx isn't easy to examine. And there may be no symptoms at first.
Treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma usually involves radiation therapy, chemotherapy or a mix of the two. Work with your healthcare professional to find the approach that's right for you.","Nasopharyngeal carcinoma may not cause signs or symptoms at first. When it does cause symptoms, they might include: | A lump in your neck caused by a swollen lymph node. | Bleeding from the nose. | Bloody saliva. | Double vision. | Ear infections. | Facial numbness. | Headaches. | Hearing loss. | Nasal stuffiness. | Ringing in the ears, called tinnitus. | Sore throat.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nasopharyngeal-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20375529

Neck pain,"Neck pain is common. Poor posture — whether from leaning over a computer or hunching over a workbench — strains neck muscles. Osteoarthritis also is a common cause of neck pain.
Rarely, neck pain can be a symptom of a more serious problem. Seek medical care for neck pain with numbness or loss of strength in the arms or hands or for pain that shoots into a shoulder or down an arm.","Symptoms include: | Pain that's often worsened by holding the head in one place for long periods, such as when driving or working at a computer | Muscle tightness and spasms | Decreased ability to move the head | Headache",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/neck-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20375581
Wilms tumor,"Wilms tumor is a rare kidney cancer that mainly affects children. Also known as nephroblastoma, it's the most common cancer of the kidneys in children. Wilms tumor most often affects children ages 3 to 4. It becomes much less common after age 5, but it can affect older children and even adults.
Wilms tumor mostly occurs in just one kidney. But it can sometimes be in both kidneys at the same time.
Over the years, progress in the diagnosis and treatment of Wilms tumor has greatly improved the prognosis for children with this disease. With treatment, the outlook for most children with Wilms tumor is good.","Symptoms of Wilms tumor vary a lot. Some children don't seem to have any symptoms. But others with Wilms tumor have one or more of these symptoms: | A mass in the stomach area that can be felt. | Swelling in the stomach area. | Pain in the stomach area. | Other symptoms might include: | Fever. | Blood in the urine. | Low red blood cell level, also known as anemia. | High blood pressure.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/wilms-tumor/symptoms-causes/syc-20352655
Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis,"Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is a rare disease that occurs mainly in people with advanced kidney failure with or without dialysis. Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis may resemble skin diseases, such as scleroderma and scleromyxedema, with thickening and darkening developing on large areas of the skin.
Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis can also affect internal organs, such as the heart and lungs, and it can cause a disabling shortening of muscles and tendons in the joints (joint contracture).
For some people with advanced kidney disease, being exposed to older gadolinium-based contrast agents (group 1) during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other imaging studies has been identified as a trigger for development of this disease. Recognition of this link has dramatically reduced the incidence of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Newer gadolinium-based contrast agents (group 2) are not associated with an increased risk of systemic nephrogenic fibrosis.","Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis can begin days to months, and even years, after exposure to an older gadolinium-based contrast agent (group 1). Some signs and symptoms of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis may include: | Swelling and tightening of the skin | Reddened or darkened patches on the skin | Thickening and hardening of the skin, typically on the arms and legs and sometimes on the body, but almost never on the face or head | Skin that may feel ""woody"" and develop an orange-peel appearance | Burning, itching or severe sharp pains in areas of involvement | Skin thickening that inhibits movement, resulting in loss of joint flexibility | Rarely, blisters or ulcers | In some people, involvement of muscles and body organs may cause: | Muscle weakness | Limitation of joint motion caused by muscle tightening (contractures) in arms, hands, legs and feet | Bone pain, particularly in the hip bones or ribs | Reduced internal organ function, including heart, lung, diaphragm, gastrointestinal tract or liver | Yellow plaques on the white surface (sclera) of the eyes | The condition is generally long term (chronic), but some people may improve.

Postherpetic neuralgia,"Postherpetic neuralgia (post-hur-PET-ik noo-RAL-juh) is the most common complication of shingles. It causes a burning pain in nerves and skin. The pain lasts long after the rash and blisters of shingles go away.
The risk of postherpetic neuralgia rises with age. It mainly affects people older than 60. There's no cure, but treatments can ease symptoms. For most people, postherpetic neuralgia gets better over time.","In general, the symptoms of postherpetic neuralgia are limited to the area of skin where the shingles outbreak first happened. That's commonly in a band around the trunk of the body, most often on one side. | The symptoms might include: | Pain that lasts three months or longerafter the shingles rash has healed. The pain may feel burning, sharp and jabbing. Or it may feel deep and aching. | Not being able to stand light touch.People with postherpetic neuralgia often can't bear even the touch of clothing on the affected skin. | Itching or loss of feeling.Less often, postherpetic neuralgia can cause an itchy feeling or numbness.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/postherpetic-neuralgia/symptoms-causes/syc-20376588
Trigeminal neuralgia,"Trigeminal neuralgia (try-JEM-ih-nul nu-RAL-juh) is a condition that causes intense pain similar to an electric shock on one side of the face. It affects the trigeminal nerve, which carries signals from the face to the brain. Even light touch from brushing your teeth or putting on makeup may trigger a jolt of pain. Trigeminal neuralgia can be long-lasting. It's known as a chronic pain condition.
People with trigeminal neuralgia may at first experience short, mild episodes of pain. But the condition can get worse, causing longer periods of pain that happen more often. It's more common in women and people older than 50.
But trigeminal neuralgia, also known as tic douloureux, doesn't mean living a life of pain. It usually can be managed with treatment.","Trigeminal neuralgia symptoms may include one or more of these patterns: | Episodes of intense shooting or jabbing pain that may feel like an electric shock. | Sudden episodes of pain or pain triggered by touching the face, chewing, speaking or brushing your teeth. | Episodes of pain lasting from a few seconds to several minutes. | Pain that occurs with facial spasms. | Episodes of pain lasting days, weeks, months or longer. Some people have periods when they experience no pain. | Pain in areas supplied by the trigeminal nerve. These areas include the cheek, jaw, teeth, gums or lips. Less often, the eye and forehead may be affected. | Pain on one side of the face at a time. | Pain focused in one spot. Or the pain may be spread in a wider pattern. | Pain that rarely occurs while sleeping. | Episodes of pain that become more frequent and intense over time.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/trigeminal-neuralgia/symptoms-causes/syc-20353344
Schwannomatosis,"Schwannomatosis is a condition that results in slow-growing tumors on nerve tissue. The tumors can grow on nerves in the ears, brain, spine and eyes. They also can grow on peripheral nerves, which are nerves located outside of the brain and spinal cord. Schwannomatosis is rare. It's usually diagnosed in early adulthood.
There are three types of schwannomatosis. Each type is caused by an altered gene.
In NF2-related schwannomatosis (NF2), tumors grow in both ears and can cause hearing loss. The altered gene that causes this type is sometimes passed down from a parent. NF2-related schwannomatosis was previously known as neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2).
The other two types of schwannomatosis are SMARCB1-related schwannomatosis and LZTR1-related schwannomatosis. The altered genes that cause these types usually are not passed down through families.
The tumors caused by schwannomatosis usually are not cancerous. Symptoms can include headaches, hearing loss, trouble with balance and pain. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms.",Schwannomatosis symptoms depend on the type.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/schwannomatosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20567542
Vasovagal syncope,"Vasovagal syncope (vay-zoh-VAY-gul SING-kuh-pee) occurs when you faint because your body overreacts to certain triggers. These may include the sight of blood or extreme emotional distress. Vasovagal syncope also is called neurocardiogenic syncope.
The vasovagal syncope trigger causes your heart rate and blood pressure to drop suddenly. That leads to reduced blood flow to your brain, causing you to briefly lose consciousness.
Vasovagal syncope is usually harmless and requires no treatment. But it's possible that you may injure yourself during a vasovagal syncope episode. Your healthcare professional may recommend tests to rule out more-serious causes of fainting, such as heart conditions.","Before you faint due to vasovagal syncope, you may experience some of the following symptoms: | Change in skin color. | Lightheadedness. | Tunnel vision — your field of vision narrows so that you see only what's in front of you. | Upset stomach. | Feeling warm. | A cold, clammy sweat. | Blurred vision. | During a vasovagal syncope episode, people around you may notice: | Jerky movements. | A slow, weak pulse. | Dilated pupils. | Recovery after a vasovagal episode generally begins in less than a minute. However, if you stand up too soon after fainting — within about 15 to 30 minutes — you're at risk of fainting again.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vasovagal-syncope/symptoms-causes/syc-20350527
Neurodermatitis,"Neurodermatitis is a skin condition that starts with an itchy patch of skin. Scratching makes it itch more. With more scratching, the skin becomes thick and leathery. You may develop several itchy spots, typically on the neck, wrists, forearms, legs or groin area.
Neurodermatitis — also known as lichen simplex chronicus — is not life-threatening or contagious. But the itching can be so intense it disrupts your sleep, sexual function and quality of life.
Breaking the itch-scratch cycle of neurodermatitis is challenging, and neurodermatitis is usually a long-term condition. It may clear up with treatment but often returns. Treatment focuses on controlling the itching and preventing scratching. It also may help to identify and eliminate factors that worsen your symptoms, such as dry skin.","Symptoms of neurodermatitis include: | An itchy, scaly skin patch or patches | Open sores that bleed | Thick, leathery skin | Discolored, wrinkled genital skin | Raised, rough patches that are inflamed or darker than the rest of the skin | The condition involves areas that can be reached for scratching — the scalp, neck, wrists, forearms, ankles, vulva, scrotum and anus. The itchiness, which can be intense, may come and go or be nonstop. You may scratch your skin out of habit and while sleeping.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/neurodermatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20375634
Merkel cell carcinoma,"Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare type of skin cancer. It most often appears as a bump on the face, head or neck. Merkel cell carcinoma also is called neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin.
Merkel cell carcinoma most often happens in people older than 50. Long-term sun exposure or a weakened immune system may raise the risk of getting this cancer.
Merkel cell carcinoma tends to grow fast and to spread quickly to other parts of the body. Treatment may depend on whether the cancer has spread beyond the skin.","The first symptom of Merkel cell carcinoma most often is a growth on the skin. This skin cancer can happen anywhere on the body. It happens most often on skin that typically gets sunlight. In white people, the growth is most likely to be on the head or neck. In Black people, the growth more often is on the legs. | A Merkel cell carcinoma can cause: | A bump on the skin that often is painless. | A bump that grows quickly. | A bump whose two sides don't match. | A bump that looks pink, purple, red-brown, or the same color as the skin around it.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/merkel-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20351030
Neuroendocrine tumors,"Neuroendocrine tumors are cancers that begin in specialized cells called neuroendocrine cells. Neuroendocrine cells have traits similar to those of nerve cells and hormone-producing cells.
Neuroendocrine tumors are rare and can occur anywhere in the body. Most neuroendocrine tumors occur in the lungs, appendix, small intestine, rectum and pancreas.
There are many types of neuroendocrine tumors. Some grow slowly and some grow very quickly. Some neuroendocrine tumors produce excess hormones (functional neuroendocrine tumors). Others don't release hormones or don't release enough to cause symptoms (nonfunctional neuroendocrine tumors).
Diagnosis and treatment of neuroendocrine tumors depend on the type of tumor, its location, whether it produces excess hormones, how aggressive it is and whether it has spread to other parts of the body.","Neuroendocrine tumors don't always cause signs and symptoms at first. The symptoms you might experience depend on the location of your tumor and whether it produces excess hormones. | In general, neuroendocrine tumor signs and symptoms might include: | Pain from a growing tumor | A growing lump you can feel under the skin | Feeling unusually tired | Losing weight without trying | Neuroendocrine tumors that produce excess hormones (functional tumors) might cause: | Skin flushing | Diarrhea | Frequent urination | Increased thirst | Dizziness | Shakiness | Skin rash",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/neuroendocrine-tumors/symptoms-causes/syc-20354132
Neurofibroma,"A  neurofibroma is a type of peripheral nerve tumor that forms a soft bump on or under the skin. The tumor can develop within a major or minor nerve anywhere in the body.
This common type of nerve tumor tends to form centrally within the nerve. A neurofibroma forms on the protective covering of the nerve, known as the nerve sheath. Sometimes it grows on several nerve bundles. When this happens, it's called a plexiform neurofibroma.
A neurofibroma may cause mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. If the tumor presses against nerves or grows within them, it may cause pain or numbness.
A neurofibroma usually isn't cancer. Rarely, it can become cancer.","A neurofibroma might cause no symptoms. If symptoms occur, they're usually mild. When a neurofibroma grows on or under the skin, symptoms may include: | A bump on the skin. The bump may be the color of your skin or pink or tan. | Pain. | Bleeding. | If a neurofibroma becomes large or presses against or grows on a nerve, symptoms may include: | Pain. | Tingling. | Numbness or weakness. | Change in appearance when a large neurofibroma is on the face. | Some people with neurofibromas have a genetic condition known as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). A person with NF1 may have many neurofibromas. The number of neurofibromas increases with age. | A tumor that involves many nerves, known as a plexiform neurofibroma, can occur in a person with NF1. This type of neurofibroma can grow large and cause pain. It also can become cancerous.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/neurofibroma/symptoms-causes/syc-20573693
Neurofibromatosis type 1,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic condition that causes changes in skin pigment and tumors on nerve tissue. Skin changes include flat, light brown spots and freckles in the armpits and groin. Tumors can grow anywhere in the nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord and nerves. NF1 is rare. About 1 in 2,500 is affected by NF1.
The tumors often are not cancerous, known as benign tumors. But sometimes they can become cancerous. Symptoms often are mild. But complications can occur and may include trouble with learning, heart and blood vessel conditions, vision loss, and pain.
Treatment focuses on supporting healthy growth and development in children and early management of complications. If NF1 causes large tumors or tumors that press on a nerve, surgery can reduce symptoms. A newer medicine is available to treat tumors in children, and other new treatments are being developed.","Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) usually is diagnosed during childhood. Symptoms are seen at birth or shortly afterward and almost always by age 10. Symptoms tend to be mild to moderate, but they can vary from person to person. | Symptoms include: | Flat, light brown spots on the skin, known as cafe au lait spots.These harmless spots are common in many people. But having more than six cafe au lait spots suggests NF1. They often are present at birth or appear during the first years of life. After childhood, new spots stop appearing. | Freckling in the armpits or groin area.Freckling often appears by ages 3 to 5. Freckles are smaller than cafe au lait spots and tend to occur in clusters in skin folds. | Tiny bumps on the iris of the eye, known as Lisch nodules.These nodules can't easily be seen and don't affect vision. | Soft, pea-sized bumps on or under the skin called neurofibromas.These benign tumors usually grow in or under the skin but can also grow inside the body. A growth that involves many nerves is called a plexiform neurofibroma. Plexiform neurofibromas, when located on the face, can cause disfigurement. Neurofibromas may increase in number with age. | Bone changes.Changes in bone development and low bone mineral density can cause bones to form in an irregular way. People with NF1 may have a curved spine, known as scoliosis, or a bowed lower leg. | Tumor on the nerve that connects the eye to the brain, called an optic pathway glioma.This tumor usually appears by age 3. The tumor rarely appears in late childhood and among teenagers, and almost never in adults. | Learning disabilities.It's common for children with NF1 to have some trouble with learning. Often there is a specific learning disability, such as trouble with reading or math. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and speech delay also are common. | Larger than average head size.Children with NF1 tend to have a larger than average head size due to increased brain volume. | Short stature.Children who have NF1 often are below average in height.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/neurofibromatosis-type-1/symptoms-causes/syc-20350490
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors are rare cancers that start in the lining of the nerves. These cancers happen in the nerves that run from the spinal cord into the body, called peripheral nerves. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors used to be called neurofibrosarcomas.
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors can happen anywhere in the body. They mostly occur in the deep tissue of the arms, legs and trunk. They tend to cause pain and weakness where they occur. They might also cause a growing lump or mass.
Surgery is the usual treatment for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Sometimes, treatment might include radiation therapy and chemotherapy.",Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors often cause symptoms that get worse quickly. Symptoms include: | Pain where the tumor is growing. | Weakness when trying to move the body part that has the tumor. | A growing lump of tissue under the skin.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/malignant-peripheral-nerve-sheath-tumors/symptoms-causes/syc-20362603
Morton's neuroma,"Morton's neuroma is a painful condition that affects the ball of your foot, most commonly the area between your third and fourth toes. Morton's neuroma may feel as if you are standing on a pebble in your shoe or on a fold in your sock.
Morton's neuroma involves a thickening of the tissue around one of the nerves leading to your toes. This can cause a sharp, burning pain in the ball of your foot. You may have stinging, burning or numbness in the affected toes.
High-heeled or tight shoes have been linked to the development of Morton's neuroma. Many people experience relief by switching to lower heeled shoes with wider toe boxes. Sometimes corticosteroid injections or surgery may be necessary.","Typically, there's no outward sign of this condition, such as a lump. Instead, you may experience the following symptoms: | A feeling as if you're standing on a pebble in your shoe | A burning pain in the ball of your foot that may radiate into your toes | Tingling or numbness in your toes | In addition to these symptoms, you may find that removing your shoe and rubbing your foot often helps to relieve the pain.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mortons-neuroma/symptoms-causes/syc-20351935
Neuromyelitis optica,"Neuromyelitis optica, also known as NMO, is a central nervous system disorder that causes inflammation in nerves of the eye and the spinal cord.
NMOalso is called neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and Devic disease. It occurs when the immune system reacts against the body's own cells. This happens mainly in the spinal cord and in the optic nerves that connect the retina of the eye with the brain. But it sometimes happens in the brain.
The condition may appear after an infection, or it can be linked with another autoimmune condition. Altered antibodies bind to proteins in the central nervous system and cause damage.
Neuromyelitis optica is often misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis, also known as MS, or is seen as a type ofMS. ButNMOis a different condition.
Neuromyelitis optica can cause blindness, weakness in the legs or arms, and painful spasms. It also can cause loss of sensation, vomiting and hiccups, and bladder or bowel symptoms.
Symptoms can get better and then worse again, known as a relapse. Treatment to prevent relapses is important to help prevent disability.NMOcan cause permanent vision loss and trouble walking.","Symptoms of neuromyelitis optica are related to the inflammation that occurs in the nerves of the eye and spinal cord. | Vision changes caused byNMOare called optic neuritis. These may include: | Blurred vision or loss of vision in one or both eyes. | Not being able to see color. | Eye pain. | Symptoms related to the spinal cord are called transverse myelitis. These may include: | Stiffness, weakness or numbness in the legs and sometimes in the arms. | Loss of feeling in the arms or legs. | Not being able to empty the bladder or trouble managing bowel or bladder function. | A tingling feeling or shooting pain in the neck, back or stomach. | Other symptoms ofNMOmay include: | Hiccups. | Nausea and vomiting. | Children can have confusion, seizures or coma. However, these symptoms in children are more common in a related condition known as myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD). | Symptoms may get better and then worse again. When they get worse, it's known as a relapse. Relapses can happen after weeks, months or years.

Peripheral neuropathy,"Peripheral neuropathy happens when the nerves that are located outside of the brain and spinal cord (peripheral nerves) are damaged. This condition often causes weakness, numbness and pain, usually in the hands and feet. It also can affect other areas and body functions including digestion and urination.
The peripheral nervous system sends information from the brain and spinal cord, also called the central nervous system, to the rest of the body through motor nerves. The peripheral nerves also send sensory information to the central nervous system through sensory nerves.
Peripheral neuropathy can result from traumatic injuries, infections, metabolic problems, inherited causes and exposure to toxins. One of the most common causes of neuropathy is diabetes.
People with peripheral neuropathy usually describe the pain as stabbing, burning or tingling. Sometimes symptoms get better, especially if caused by a condition that can be treated. Medicines can reduce the pain of peripheral neuropathy.","Every nerve in the peripheral system has a specific job. Symptoms depend on the type of nerves affected. Nerves are divided into: | Sensory nerves that receive sensation, such as temperature, pain, vibration or touch, from the skin. | Motor nerves that control muscle movement. | Autonomic nerves that control functions such as blood pressure, sweating, heart rate, digestion and bladder function. | Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy might include: | Gradual onset of numbness, prickling, or tingling in your feet or hands. These sensations can spread upward into your legs and arms. | Sharp, jabbing, throbbing or burning pain. | Extreme sensitivity to touch. | Pain during activities that shouldn't cause pain, such as pain in your feet when putting weight on them or when they're under a blanket. | Lack of coordination and falling. | Muscle weakness. | Feeling as if you're wearing gloves or socks when you're not. | Inability to move if motor nerves are affected. | If autonomic nerves are affected, symptoms might include: | Heat intolerance. | Excessive sweating or not being able to sweat. | Bowel, bladder or digestive problems. | Drops in blood pressure, causing dizziness or lightheadedness. | Peripheral neuropathy can affect one nerve, called mononeuropathy. If it affects two or more nerves in different areas, it's called multiple mononeuropathy, and if it affects many nerves, it's called polyneuropathy. Carpal tunnel syndrome is an example of mononeuropathy. Most people with peripheral neuropathy have polyneuropathy.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peripheral-neuropathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20352061
Moles,"Moles, also known as nevi, are a common type of skin growth. They often appear as small, dark brown spots that are caused by clusters of pigment-forming cells called melanocytes. Most people have 10 to 45 moles that appear during childhood and the teenage years. How these moles look may change over time. They also may fade over time.
Most moles are harmless. Rarely, they become cancerous. Being aware of changes in your moles and other pigmented patches is important to finding skin cancer, especially malignant melanoma.","The typical mole is a small brown spot. But moles come in different colors, shapes and sizes: | Color and texture.Moles can be brown, tan, black, blue, red or pink. They can be smooth, wrinkled, flat or raised. They may have hair growing from them. | Shape.Most moles are oval or round. | Size.Moles are typically less than 1/4 inch (about 6 mm) in diameter — the size of a pencil eraser. Those present at birth, known as congenital nevi, can be bigger and cover part of the face, trunk or a limb. | Moles can grow anywhere on your body, including your scalp and armpits, as well as under your nails and between your fingers and toes. Most people have 10 to 45 moles. Many of these moles occur by age 40. Moles may change or fade away over time. They may become darker and larger with hormonal changes that occur during the teenage years and while pregnant. | Clusters of brown spots around the eyes, cheeks and nose are dermatoses papulosa nigra — a type of seborrheic keratosis that is noncancerous and appears as waxy brown, black or tan growths. They aren't clusters of pigment-forming cells, known as nevi. Dermatoses papulosa nigra are more common among Black women.

Nicotine dependence,"Nicotine dependence occurs when you need nicotine and can't stop using it. Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that makes it hard to quit. Nicotine produces pleasing effects in your brain, but these effects are temporary. So you reach for another cigarette.
The more you smoke, the more nicotine you need to feel good. When you try to stop, you experience unpleasant mental and physical changes. These are symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.
Regardless of how long you've smoked, stopping can improve your health. It isn't easy but you can break your dependence on nicotine. Many effective treatments are available. Ask your doctor for help.","For some people, using any amount of tobacco can quickly lead to nicotine dependence. Signs that you may be addicted include: | You can't stop smoking.You've made one or more serious, but unsuccessful, attempts to stop. | You have withdrawal symptoms when you try to stop.Your attempts at stopping have caused physical and mood-related symptoms, such as strong cravings, anxiety, irritability, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, depressed mood, frustration, anger, increased hunger, insomnia, constipation or diarrhea. | You keep smoking despite health problems.Even though you've developed health problems with your lungs or your heart, you haven't been able to stop. | You give up social activities.You may stop going to smoke-free restaurants or stop socializing with family or friends because you can't smoke in these situations.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nicotine-dependence/symptoms-causes/syc-20351584
Niemann-Pick disease,"Niemann-Pick disease is a group of rare conditions passed down in families. The conditions affect the body's ability to break down and use fats, such as cholesterol and lipids, inside cells. Because of the buildup of fats, these cells don't work as they should and, over time, the cells die. Niemann-Pick disease can affect the brain, nerves, liver, spleen and bone marrow. Sometimes it can affect the lungs.
Symptoms of Niemann-Pick disease relate to worsening function of the nerves, brain and other organs over time.
Niemann-Pick disease can happen at different ages but mainly affects children. The condition has no known cure and is sometimes fatal. Treatment is focused on helping people live with their symptoms.","The three main types of Niemann-Pick disease are called A, B and C. Symptoms differ widely but depend in part on the type and how severe the condition is. Symptoms may include: | Loss of muscle control, such as clumsiness and problems walking. | Muscle weakness and floppiness. | Stiff and awkward movements. | Vision problems, such as vision loss and eye movements that can't be controlled. | Hearing loss. | Being sensitive to touch. | Problems sleeping. | Problems swallowing and eating. | Slurred speech. | Problems with learning and memory that get worse. | Mental health conditions, such as depression, paranoia and behavior problems. | Liver and spleen that get too large. | Repeated infections that cause pneumonia. | Some infants with type A show symptoms within the first few months of life. Those with type B may not show symptoms for years and have a better chance of living to adulthood. People with type C can start to have symptoms at any age but may not have any symptoms until adulthood.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/niemann-pick/symptoms-causes/syc-20355887
Sleep terrors (night terrors),"Sleep terrors are times of screaming or crying, intense fear, and sometimes waving arms and legs when not fully awake. Also known as night terrors, sleep terrors may lead to sleepwalking. Like sleepwalking, sleep terrors are a type of parasomnia. Parasomnias are disturbing or strange behaviors or experiences during sleep. A sleep terror usually lasts from seconds to a few minutes, but it may last longer.
Sleep terrors may happen in children between the ages of 1 and 12 years. They happen much less often in adults. Although sleep terrors can be frightening to those around the person with sleep terrors, they aren't usually a cause for concern. Most children outgrow sleep terrors by their teenage years.
Sleep terrors may need treatment if they cause problems with getting enough sleep or cause a safety risk.","Sleep terrors differ from nightmares. A nightmare is a bad dream. The person who has a nightmare wakes up from the dream and may remember details. A person who has a sleep terror remains asleep. Children usually don't remember anything about their sleep terrors in the morning. Adults may recall part of a dream they had during the sleep terrors. | Sleep terrors generally happen in the first part of sleep time, and rarely during naps. A sleep terror may lead to sleepwalking. | During a sleep terror, a person may: | Start by screaming, shouting or crying. | Sit up in bed and look scared. | Stare wide-eyed. | Sweat, breathe heavily, and have a racing pulse, flushed face and enlarged pupils. | Kick and thrash. | Be hard to wake up and be confused if awakened. | Not be comforted or soothed. | Have no or little memory of the event the next morning. | Possibly, get out of bed and run around the house or have aggressive behavior if blocked or held back.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-terrors/symptoms-causes/syc-20353524
Nightmare disorder,"A nightmare is a disturbing dream associated with negative feelings, such as anxiety or fear that awakens you. Nightmares are common in children but can happen at any age. Occasional nightmares usually are nothing to worry about.
Nightmares may begin in children between 3 and 6 years old and tend to decrease after the age of 10. During the teen and young adult years, girls appear to have nightmares more often than boys do. Some people have them as adults or throughout their lives.
Although nightmares are common, nightmare disorder is relatively rare. Nightmare disorder is when nightmares happen often, cause distress, disrupt sleep, cause problems with daytime functioning or create fear of going to sleep.","You're more likely to have a nightmare in the second half of your night. Nightmares may occur rarely or more frequently, even several times a night. Episodes are generally brief, but they cause you to awaken, and returning to sleep can be difficult. | A nightmare may involve these features: | Your dream seems vivid and real and is very upsetting, often becoming more disturbing as the dream unfolds. | Your dream storyline is usually related to threats to safety or survival, but it can have other disturbing themes. | Your dream awakens you. | You feel scared, anxious, angry, sad or disgusted as a result of your dream. | You feel sweaty or have a pounding heartbeat while in bed. | You can think clearly upon awakening and can recall details of your dream. | Your dream causes distress that keeps you from falling back to sleep easily. | Nightmares are only considered a disorder if you experience: | Frequent occurrences | Major distress or impairment during the day, such as anxiety or persistent fear, or bedtime anxiety about having another nightmare | Problems with concentration or memory, or you can't stop thinking about images from your dreams | Daytime sleepiness, fatigue or low energy | Problems functioning at work or school or in social situations | Behavior problems related to bedtime or fear of the dark | Having a child with nightmare disorder can cause significant sleep disturbance and distress for parents or caregivers. | Occasional nightmares aren't usually a cause for concern. If your child has nightmares, you can simply mention them at a routine well-child exam. However, consult your doctor if nightmares: | Occur frequently and persist over time | Routinely disrupt sleep | Cause fear of going to sleep | Cause daytime behavior problems or difficulty functioning",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nightmare-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20353515
Bed-wetting,"Bed-wetting — also called nighttime incontinence or nocturnal enuresis — means passing urine without intending to while asleep. This happens after the age at which staying dry at night can be reasonably expected.
Soggy sheets and pajamas — and an embarrassed child — are a familiar scene in many homes. But don't get upset if your child wets the bed. Bed-wetting isn't a sign of problems with toilet training. It's often just a typical part of a child's development.
Generally, bed-wetting before age 7 isn't a concern. At this age, your child may still be developing nighttime bladder control.
If your child continues to wet the bed, treat the problem with patience and understanding. Lifestyle changes, bladder training, moisture alarms and sometimes medicine may help lessen bed-wetting.","Most kids are fully toilet trained by age 5, but there's really no target date for having complete bladder control. Between the ages of 5 and 7, bed-wetting remains a problem for some children. After 7 years of age, a small number of children still wet the bed.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bed-wetting/symptoms-causes/syc-20366685
Hearing loss,"Hearing loss that comes on little by little as you age, also known as presbycusis, is common. More than half the people in the United States older than age 75 have some age-related hearing loss.

Aging and being around loud noises both can cause hearing loss. Other factors, such as too much earwax, can lower how well ears work for a time.
You usually can't get hearing back. But there are ways to improve what you hear.","Symptoms of hearing loss may include: | Muffling of speech and other sounds. | Trouble understanding words, especially when in a crowd or a noisy place. | Trouble hearing the letters of the alphabet that aren't vowels. | Often asking others to speak more slowly, clearly and loudly. | Needing to turn up the volume of the television or radio. | Staying clear of some social settings. | Being bothered by background noise. | Ringing in the ears, known as tinnitus.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hearing-loss/symptoms-causes/syc-20373072

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma,"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is made up of organs, glands, tubelike vessels and clusters of cells called lymph nodes. It's part of the body's germ-fighting immune system.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma happens when germ-fighting cells in the lymphatic system grow out of control. The cells can form growths, called tumors, throughout the body.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a broad group of lymphomas. There are many subtypes in this group. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma are among the most common subtypes. The other broad group of lymphoma is Hodgkin lymphoma.
Advances in diagnosis and treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma have helped improve the prognosis for people with this condition.","Signs and symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma may include: | Swollen lymph nodes in the neck, armpits or groin. | Belly pain or swelling. | Chest pain, coughing or trouble breathing. | Feeling very tired. | Fever. | Night sweats. | Weight loss without trying.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/non-hodgkins-lymphoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20375680

Nonmelanoma skin cancer,"Nonmelanoma skin cancer refers to all the types of cancer that happen in the skin that are not melanoma.
Several types of skin cancer fall within the broader category of nonmelanoma skin cancer. Almost all nonmelanoma skin cancers are either basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Other types of nonmelanoma skin cancer are rare.
Nonmelanoma skin cancer treatment depends on the type of cancer. Skin cancer treatment usually involves surgery to remove the cancer cells.","Symptoms of nonmelanoma skin cancer often develop on parts of the body that are exposed to the sun. Examples include the scalp, face, ears, neck, chest, arms and hands. But nonmelanoma skin cancer can happen on other parts of the body too. This includes the lips, fingers, fingernails and genital areas. | Nonmelanoma skin cancer symptoms appear as a change in the skin, including: | A new growth on the skin. | Changes to an existing skin spot, such as changes in shape or color. | Itching, pain, crusting or bleeding of a skin spot. | A sore that won't heal or one that keeps coming back.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nonmelanoma-skin-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355397
Celiac disease,"Celiac disease is an illness caused by an immune reaction to eating gluten. Gluten is a protein found in foods containing wheat, barley or rye.
If you have celiac disease, eating gluten triggers an immune response to the gluten protein in your small intestine. Over time, this reaction damages your small intestine's lining and prevents it from absorbing nutrients, a condition called malabsorption.
The intestinal damage often causes symptoms such as diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, bloating or anemia. It also can lead to serious complications if it is not managed or treated. In children, malabsorption can affect growth and development in addition to gastrointestinal symptoms.
There's no definite cure for celiac disease. But for most people, following a strict gluten-free diet can help manage symptoms and help the intestines heal.","The symptoms of celiac disease can vary greatly. They also may be different in children and adults. Digestive symptoms for adults include: | Diarrhea. | Fatigue. | Weight loss. | Bloating and gas. | Abdominal pain. | Nausea and vomiting. | Constipation. | However, more than half the adults with celiac disease have symptoms that are not related to the digestive system, including: | Anemia, usually from iron deficiency due to decreased iron absorption. | Loss of bone density, called osteoporosis, or softening of bones, called osteomalacia. | Itchy, blistery skin rash, called dermatitis herpetiformis. | Mouth ulcers. | Headaches and fatigue. | Nervous system injury, including numbness and tingling in the feet and hands, possible problems with balance, and cognitive impairment. | Joint pain. | Reduced functioning of the spleen, known as hyposplenism. | Elevated liver enzymes.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/celiac-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352220
Functional dyspepsia,"Functional dyspepsia is a term used to describe a lingering upset stomach that has no obvious cause. Functional dyspepsia (dis-PEP-see-uh) also is called nonulcer dyspepsia.
Functional dyspepsia is common. It is a constant condition, but symptoms don't happen all the time. Symptoms are like those of an ulcer. They include pain or discomfort in the upper belly, bloating, belching and nausea.","Symptoms of functional dyspepsia may include: | Pain or burning in the stomach, bloating, excessive belching or nausea after eating. | An early feeling of fullness when eating. The feeling of fullness also is called satiety. | Stomach pain that happens unrelated to meals or goes away when eating.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/functional-dyspepsia/symptoms-causes/syc-20375709
Noonan syndrome,"Noonan syndrome is a genetic condition that stops typical development in various parts of the body. It can affect a person in several ways, including unusual facial features, short height, heart problems and other physical problems. It also can cause a child to develop more slowly than usual, for example, in walking, talking or learning new things.
A changed gene causes Noonan syndrome. A child inherits a copy of an affected gene from a parent. This is called dominant inheritance. The condition also can occur as a spontaneous change. This means there's no family history involved.
Doctors manage Noonan syndrome by controlling the symptoms and complications. They may use a growth hormone to treat short height in some people with Noonan syndrome.",Symptoms of Noonan syndrome vary greatly and range from mild to severe. These symptoms may be related to the specific gene containing the change.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/noonan-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20354422

Compulsive sexual behavior,"Compulsive sexual behavior is sometimes called hypersexuality or sexual addiction. It's an intense focus on sexual fantasies, urges or behaviors that can't be controlled. This causes distress and problems for your health, job, relationships or other parts of your life.
Compulsive sexual behavior may involve different kinds of commonly enjoyable sexual experiences. Examples include masturbation, sexual arousal by using a computer to communicate, multiple sexual partners, use of pornography or paying for sex. But when these sexual behaviors become a major, constant focus in your life, are difficult to control, cause problems in your life, or are harmful to you or others, that's likely compulsive sexual behavior.
No matter what it's called or the exact nature of the behavior, untreated compulsive sexual behavior can damage your self-esteem, relationships, career, health and other people. But with treatment and self-help, you can learn to manage compulsive sexual behavior.","Some signs that you may have compulsive sexual behavior include: | You have repeated and intense sexual fantasies, urges, and behaviors that take up a lot of your time and feel as if they're beyond your control. | You feel driven or have frequent urges to do certain sexual behaviors, feel a release of the tension afterward, but also feel guilt or deep regret. | You've tried without success to reduce or control your sexual fantasies, urges or behavior. | You use compulsive sexual behavior as an escape from other problems, such as loneliness, depression, anxiety or stress. | You continue to engage in sexual behaviors in spite of them causing serious problems. These could include the possibility of getting or giving someone else a sexually transmitted infection, the loss of important relationships, trouble at work, financial issues, or legal problems. | You have trouble making and keeping healthy and stable relationships.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/compulsive-sexual-behavior/symptoms-causes/syc-20360434
Overactive bladder,"Overactive bladder, also called OAB, causes sudden urges to urinate that may be hard to control. There might be a need to pass urine many times during the day and night. There also might be loss of urine that isn't intended, called urgency incontinence.
People with an overactive bladder might feel self-conscious. That can cause them to keep away from others or limit their work and social life. The good news is that it can be treated.
Simple behavior changes might manage symptoms of an overactive bladder. These might include changes in diet, urinating on a certain schedule and using pelvic floor muscles to control the bladder. There also are other treatments to try.","If you have an overactive bladder, you may: | Feel a sudden urge to urinate that's hard to control. | Lose urine without meaning to after an urgent need to urinate, called urgency incontinence. | Urinate often. This can mean eight or more times in 24 hours. | Wake up more than twice a night to urinate, called nocturia. | Even if you can get to the toilet in time when you feel an urge to urinate, having to urinate often during day and night can disrupt your life.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/overactive-bladder/symptoms-causes/syc-20355715
Obesity,"Obesity is a complex disease involving having too much body fat. Obesity isn't just a cosmetic concern. It's a medical problem that increases the risk of many other diseases and health problems. These can include heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, liver disease, sleep apnea and certain cancers.
There are many reasons why some people have trouble losing weight. Often, obesity results from inherited, physiological and environmental factors, combined with diet, physical activity and exercise choices.
The good news is that even modest weight loss can improve or prevent the health problems associated with obesity. A healthier diet, increased physical activity and behavior changes can help you lose weight. Prescription medicines and weight-loss procedures are other options for treating obesity.","Body mass index, known as BMI, is often used to diagnose obesity. To calculateBMI, multiply weight in pounds by 703, divide by height in inches and then divide again by height in inches. Or divide weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. There are several online calculators available that help calculateBMI. | SeeBMIcalculator | Asians with aBMIof 23 or higher may have an increased risk of health problems. | For most people,BMIprovides a reasonable estimate of body fat. However,BMIdoesn't directly measure body fat. Some people, such as muscular athletes, may have aBMIin the obesity category even though they don't have excess body fat. | Many health care professionals also measure around a person's waist to help guide treatment decisions. This measurement is called a waist circumference. Weight-related health problems are more common in men with a waist circumference over 40 inches (102 centimeters). They're more common in women with a waist measurement over 35 inches (89 centimeters). Body fat percentage is another measurement that may be used during a weight loss program to track progress.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742
Childhood obesity,"Childhood obesity is a serious health condition that involves having excess body fat early in life. The extra weight often starts children on the path to other health conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Childhood obesity also can lead to poor self-esteem and depression.
The symptoms of childhood obesity aren't straightforward or simply based on how children look. And various factors can play a part in causing this condition. Some factors may be within a family's ability to change, such as eating and physical activity habits. Many other possible factors can't be changed, such those related to genes and hormones.
You can help manage or prevent childhood obesity by having your whole family regularly eat balanced meals and snacks. It also helps for the whole family to lead an active lifestyle. Steps such as these help protect your child's health now and in the future.","The symptoms of childhood obesity aren't clear-cut. Not all children who carry extra pounds are overweight. Some children have larger than average body frames. And it's typical for children to carry different amounts of body fat at the various stages of development. So you might not know if weight is a concern based on how your child looks. | A measurement called the body mass index (BMI) helps healthcare professionals check for overweight status and obese status. A child'sBMIis based on the child's weight and height compared with those of other children the same age and sex using growth charts. Speak with your child's healthcare professional about how your child'sBMIfits with other clues of children's health. For instance, growth patterns, eating and activity habits, stress, sleep, and family history also play a key role in health. Other tests also can help your child's healthcare professional figure out if your child's weight might pose health risks.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/childhood-obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20354827
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD),"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) features a pattern of unwanted thoughts and fears known as obsessions. These obsessions lead you to do repetitive behaviors, also called compulsions. These obsessions and compulsions get in the way of daily activities and cause a lot of distress.
Ultimately, you feel driven to do compulsive acts to ease your stress. Even if you try to ignore or get rid of bothersome thoughts or urges, they keep coming back. This leads you to act based on ritual. This is the vicious cycle ofOCD.
OCDoften centers around certain themes, such as being overly fearful of getting contaminated by germs. To ease contamination fears, you may wash your hands over and over again until they're sore and chapped.
If you haveOCD, you may be ashamed, embarrassed and frustrated about the condition. But treatment can be effective.","Obsessive-compulsive disorder usually includes both obsessions and compulsions. But it's also possible to have only obsession symptoms or only compulsion symptoms. You may or may not know that your obsessions and compulsions are beyond reason.

Cholestasis of pregnancy,"Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, commonly known as cholestasis of pregnancy, is a liver condition that can occur in late pregnancy. The condition triggers intense itching, but without a rash. Itching is usually on the hands and feet but also can occur on other parts of the body.
Cholestasis of pregnancy can make you very uncomfortable. But more worrisome are the potential complications, especially for your baby. Because of the risk of complications, your pregnancy care provider may recommend early term delivery around 37 weeks.","Intense itching is the main symptom of cholestasis of pregnancy. But there is no rash. Typically, you feel itchy on the palms of your hands or the soles of your feet, but you may feel itchy everywhere. The itching is often worse at night and may bother you so much that you can't sleep. | The itching is most common during the third trimester of pregnancy but sometimes begins earlier. It may feel worse as your due date gets near.

Obstructive sleep apnea,"Obstructive sleep apnea is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder. People with obstructive sleep apnea repeatedly stop and start breathing while they sleep.
There are several types of sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when the throat muscles relax and block the airway. This happens off and on many times during sleep. A sign of obstructive sleep apnea is snoring.
Treatments for obstructive sleep apnea are available. One treatment is a device that uses positive pressure to keep the airway open during sleep. Another option is a mouthpiece to thrust the lower jaw forward during sleep. In some people, surgery might be an option too.","Symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea include: | Excessive daytime sleepiness. | Loud snoring. | Observed episodes of stopped breathing during sleep. | Waking during the night and gasping or choking. | Awakening in the morning with a dry mouth or sore throat. | Morning headaches. | Trouble focusing during the day. | Mood changes, such as depression or being easily upset. | High blood pressure. | Decreased interest in sex.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obstructive-sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20352090
Carcinoma of unknown primary,"Carcinoma of unknown primary is a diagnosis healthcare professionals give when they can't find where a cancer started. A carcinoma of unknown primary is an advanced cancer that has spread in the body.
Most often, health professionals detect a cancer when it grows in the place where it started. The place where a cancer started growing is called the primary cancer. Sometimes health professionals first detect a cancer when it spreads. When cancer spreads it's called metastatic cancer.
In carcinoma of unknown primary, healthcare professionals find the metastatic cancer. But they can't find the primary cancer. Carcinoma of unknown primary also is called occult primary cancer.
Healthcare teams often use the kind of primary cancer you have to help decide on the treatment. If you're found to have carcinoma of unknown primary, this piece of information is missing. Your healthcare team will work to find out what kind of cancer you have.",Signs and symptoms of carcinoma of unknown primary include: | A cough that won't go away. | Feeling very tired. | Fever that doesn't have a clear cause. | Losing weight without trying. | Nausea and vomiting. | Pain in one part of the body. | Swelling of the belly. | Swollen lymph nodes.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carcinoma-unknown-primary/symptoms-causes/syc-20370683
Occupational asthma,"Occupational asthma is a type of asthma caused by breathing in fumes, gases, dust or other substances while on the job. These substances can trigger an immune system response that changes how the lungs work. Occupational asthma also is called work-related asthma.
In asthma, the airways narrow and swell. They also may make extra mucus. This makes it difficult to breathe and may cause chest tightness, wheezing and shortness of breath.
Avoiding triggers is important for managing occupational asthma. Treatment includes medicines that reduce symptoms. For people who were diagnosed with asthma in the past, medicines may help improve symptoms related to workplace triggers.
If occupational asthma is not treated and triggers are not avoided, the asthma can cause permanent changes to the lungs.","Occupational asthma symptoms may include: | Wheezing. | Coughing. | Shortness of breath. | Chest tightness. | Other possible symptoms may include: | Runny nose. | Stuffy nose. | Itchy or watery eyes. | Occupational asthma symptoms depend on the substance you're exposed to, how long and how often you're exposed, and other factors. Your symptoms may: | Begin right after exposure to a substance, later in the day or after work. | Improve or go away on days off or during vacations and then return when you go to work. | May begin early in the day and fail to improve on days off as disease progresses. | May become permanent even after long periods away from work.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/occupational-asthma/symptoms-causes/syc-20375772
Albinism,"The term albinism usually refers to oculocutaneous (ok-u-low-ku-TAY-nee-us) albinism (OCA).OCAis a group of disorders passed down in families where the body makes little or none of a substance called melanin. The type and amount of melanin in your body determines the color of your skin, hair and eyes. Melanin also plays a role in the development and function of the eyes, so people with albinism have vision problems.
Symptoms of albinism are usually seen in a person's skin, hair and eye color, but sometimes differences are slight. People with albinism are also sensitive to the effects of the sun, so they're at higher risk of getting skin cancer.
Although there's no cure for albinism, people with the disorder can take steps to protect their skin and eyes and get proper eye and skin care.","Symptoms of albinism involve skin, hair and eye color, as well as vision.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/albinism/symptoms-causes/syc-20369184

Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD),"Even the best-behaved children can be difficult and challenging at times. But oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) includes a frequent and ongoing pattern of anger, irritability, arguing and defiance toward parents and other authority figures.ODDalso includes being spiteful and seeking revenge, a behavior called vindictiveness.
These emotional and behavioral issues cause serious problems with family life, social activities, school and work. But as a parent, you don't have to try to manage a child withODDalone. Your health care provider, a mental health professional and a child development expert can help.
Treatment ofODDinvolves learning skills to help build positive family interactions and to manage problem behaviors. Other therapy, and possibly medicines, may be needed to treat related mental health conditions.","Sometimes it's difficult to recognize the difference between a strong-willed or emotional child and one with oppositional defiant disorder. It's common for children to show oppositional behavior at certain stages of development. | Symptoms ofODDgenerally begin during preschool years. SometimesODDmay develop later, but almost always before the early teen years. Oppositional and defiant behaviors are frequent and ongoing. They cause severe problems with relationships, social activities, school and work, for both the child and the family. | Emotional and behavioral symptoms ofODDgenerally last at least six months. They include angry and irritable mood, argumentative and defiant behavior, and hurtful and revengeful behavior. | Angry and irritable mood | Often and easily loses temper. | Is frequently touchy and easily annoyed by others. | Is often angry and resentful. | Argumentative and defiant behavior | Often argues with adults or people in authority. | Often actively defies or refuses to follow adults' requests or rules. | Often annoys or upsets people on purpose. | Often blames others for their own mistakes or misbehavior. | Hurtful and revengeful behavior | Says mean and hateful things when upset. | Tries to hurt the feelings of others and seeks revenge, also called being vindictive. | Has shown vindictive behavior at least twice in the past six months. | Severity | ODDcan be mild, moderate or severe: | Mild.Symptoms occur only in one setting, such as only at home, school, work or with peers. | Moderate.Some symptoms occur in at least two settings. | Severe.Some symptoms occur in three or more settings. | For some children, symptoms may first be seen only at home.

Jaw tumors and cysts,"Jaw tumors and cysts are relatively rare growths or lesions that develop in the jawbone or the soft tissues in the mouth and face. Jaw tumors and cysts — sometimes referred to as odontogenic or nonodontogenic, depending on their origin — can vary greatly in size and severity. These growths are usually noncancerous (benign), but they can be aggressive and expand, displace or destroy the surrounding bone, tissue and teeth.
Treatment options for jaw tumors and cysts vary, depending on the type of growth or lesion you have, the stage of growth, and your symptoms. Mouth, jaw and face (oral and maxillofacial) surgeons can treat your jaw tumor or cyst usually by surgery, or in some cases, by medical therapy or a combination of surgery and medical therapy.","A tumor is an abnormal growth or mass of tissue. A cyst is a lesion that contains liquid or semisolid material. Examples of jaw tumors and cysts include: | Ameloblastoma.This rare, usually noncancerous (benign) tumor begins in the cells that form the protective enamel lining on the teeth. It develops most often in the jaw near the molars. The most common type is aggressive, forming large tumors and growing into the jawbone. Although this tumor can recur after treatment, aggressive surgical treatment will typically reduce the chance of recurrence. | Central giant cell granuloma.Central giant cell granulomas are benign lesions that grow from bone cells. They most often occur in the front portion of the lower jaw. One type of these tumors can grow rapidly, cause pain and destroy bone, and has a tendency to recur after surgical treatment. The other type is less aggressive and may not have symptoms. Rarely, a tumor may shrink or resolve on its own, but typically these tumors require surgical treatment. | Dentigerous cyst.This cyst originates from tissue that surrounds a tooth before it erupts into the mouth. This is the most common form of cyst that affects the jaws. Most often these cysts will occur around wisdom teeth that are not fully erupted, but they can also involve other teeth. | Odontogenic keratocyst.This cyst is also referred to as a keratocystic odontogenic tumor because of its tumorlike tendency to recur after surgical treatment. Although this cyst is typically slow growing, it can still be destructive to the jaw and teeth if left untreated over a long period of time. Most often the cyst develops in the lower jaw near the third molars. These cysts may also be found in people with an inherited condition called nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. | Odontogenic myxoma.This is a rare, slow-growing, benign tumor that occurs most often in the lower jaw. The tumor can be large and aggressively invade the jaw and surrounding tissue and displace teeth. Odontogenic myxomas are known to recur after surgical treatment; however, the chances of tumor recurrence are typically lessened by more-aggressive forms of surgical treatment. | Odontoma.This benign tumor is the most common odontogenic tumor. Odontomas often have no symptoms, but they may interfere with tooth development or eruption. Odontomas are made up of dental tissue that grows around a tooth in the jaw. They can resemble an oddly shaped tooth or can be a small or large calcified tumor. These tumors may be part of some genetic syndromes. | Other types of cysts and tumors.These include adenomatoid odontogenic tumor, calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor, glandular odontogenic cyst, squamous odontogenic tumor, calcifying odontogenic cyst, cementoblastoma, aneurysmal bone cyst, ossifying fibroma, osteoblastoma. central odontogenic fibroma and others.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/jaw-tumors-cysts/symptoms-causes/syc-20350973

This cancer usually affects adults. But it can occur at any age. Esthesioneuroblastoma usually begins as a growth of cells, called a tumor, inside the nose. It might grow and go into the sinuses, eyes and brain. It also can spread to other parts of the body.
People with esthesioneuroblastoma can lose their sense of smell. They might get nosebleeds. And they might have trouble breathing through their nose as the tumor grows.
Esthesioneuroblastoma treatment usually includes surgery. Often, radiation and chemotherapy are part of the treatment as well.","Esthesioneuroblastoma symptoms include: | Loss of the sense of smell. | Frequent nosebleeds. | Difficulty breathing through the nose. | As the cancer grows, it might cause eye pain, loss of vision, ear pain and headaches.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/esthesioneuroblastoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20351075
Nail fungus,"Nail fungus is a common infection of the nail. It begins as a white or yellow-brown spot under the tip of your fingernail or toenail. As the fungal infection goes deeper, the nail may discolor, thicken and crumble at the edge. Nail fungus can affect several nails.
If your condition is mild and not bothering you, you may not need treatment. If your nail fungus is painful and has caused thickened nails, self-care steps and medications may help. But even if treatment is successful, nail fungus often comes back.
Nail fungus is also called onychomycosis (on-ih-koh-my-KOH-sis). When fungus infects the areas between your toes and the skin of your feet, it's called athlete's foot (tinea pedis).","Symptoms of nail fungus include a nail or nails that are: | Thickened | Discolored | Brittle, crumbly or ragged | Misshapen | Separated from the nail bed | Smelly | Nail fungus can affect fingernails, but it's more common in toenails.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nail-fungus/symptoms-causes/syc-20353294

Oral thrush causes creamy white patches or spots, usually on the tongue or inner cheeks. Sometimes oral thrush may spread to the roof of the mouth, gums or tonsils, or the back of your throat.
Although oral thrush can affect anyone, it's more likely to occur in babies and older adults because they have lower immunity. It's also more likely to occur in other people with weakened immune systems or certain health conditions or people who take certain medicines. Oral thrush is a minor problem if you're healthy.

Orchitis often is linked with an infection of the epididymis, which is the coiled tube at the back of the testicle that stores and carries sperm. The infection of the epididymis is called epididymitis. With orchitis, the condition is called epididymo-orchitis.
Orchitis may cause pain and swelling. It is typically treated with supportive underwear, cold packs, medicines called anti-inflammatories and, in some instances, medicines called antibiotics. But it can take several weeks or even months for tenderness in the scrotum to go away.
Rarely, severe orchitis can affect being able to have children, called fertility.

Osteochondritis dissecans,"Osteochondritis dissecans (os-tee-o-kon-DRY-tis DIS-uh-kanz) is a joint condition in which bone underneath the cartilage of a joint dies due to lack of blood flow. This bone and cartilage can then break loose, causing pain and possibly hindering joint motion.
Osteochondritis dissecans occurs most often in children and adolescents. It can cause symptoms either after an injury to a joint or after several months of activity, especially high-impact activity such as jumping and running, that affects the joint. The condition occurs most commonly in the knee, but also occurs in elbows, ankles and other joints.
Doctors stage osteochondritis dissecans according to the size of the injury, whether the fragment is partially or completely detached, and whether the fragment stays in place. If the loosened piece of cartilage and bone stays in place, you may have few or no symptoms. For young children whose bones are still developing, the injury might heal by itself.
Surgery might be necessary if the fragment comes loose and gets caught between the moving parts of your joint or if you have persistent pain.","Depending on the joint that's affected, signs and symptoms of osteochondritis dissecans might include: | Pain.This most common symptom of osteochondritis dissecans might be triggered by physical activity — walking up stairs, climbing a hill or playing sports. | Swelling and tenderness.The skin around your joint might be swollen and tender. | Joint popping or locking.Your joint might pop or stick in one position if a loose fragment gets caught between bones during movement. | Joint weakness.You might feel as though your joint is ""giving way"" or weakening. | Decreased range of motion.You might be unable to straighten the affected limb completely.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteochondritis-dissecans/symptoms-causes/syc-20375887
Osteosarcoma,"Osteosarcoma is a kind of cancer that begins in the cells that form bones. Osteosarcoma tends to happen most often in teenagers and young adults. But it also can happen in younger children and older adults.
Osteosarcoma can start in any bone. It's most often found in the long bones of the legs, and sometimes the arms. Very rarely, it happens in soft tissue outside the bone.
Advances in the treatment of osteosarcoma have improved the outlook for this cancer. After treatment for osteosarcoma, people sometimes face late effects from the strong treatments used to control the cancer. Healthcare professionals often suggest lifelong monitoring for side effects after treatment.","Osteosarcoma signs and symptoms most often start in a bone. The cancer most often affects the long bones of the legs, and sometimes the arms. The most common symptoms include: | Bone or joint pain. Pain might come and go at first. It can be mistaken for growing pains. | Pain related to a bone that breaks for no clear reason. | Swelling near a bone.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteosarcoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20351052
Osteomyelitis,"Osteomyelitis is an infection in a bone. It can affect one or more parts of a bone. Infections can reach a bone through the bloodstream or from nearby infected tissue. Infections also can begin in the bone if an injury opens the bone to germs.
People who smoke and people with chronic health conditions, such as diabetes or kidney failure, are at higher risk of getting osteomyelitis. People who have diabetes with foot ulcers may get osteomyelitis in the bones of their feet.
Most people with osteomyelitis need surgery to remove areas of the affected bone. After surgery, most often people need strong antibiotics given through a vein.","Symptoms of osteomyelitis may include: | Swelling, warmth and tenderness over the area of the infection. | Pain near the infection. | Tiredness. | Fever. | Sometimes osteomyelitis causes no symptoms. When it does cause symptoms, they can be like symptoms of other conditions. This may be especially true for infants, older adults and people who have weakened immune systems.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteomyelitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20375913

Bone spurs,"Bone spurs are bony growths that form along bone edges. They're also called osteophytes. Bone spurs often form where bones meet each other — in the joints. They also can form on the bones of the spine.
The main cause of bone spurs is the joint damage linked with the most common type of arthritis. This is called osteoarthritis. Bone spurs often cause no symptoms. You might not notice them, and your healthcare team might not happen to find them for years. Bone spurs might not need treatment. If treatment is needed, it depends on where spurs are located and how they affect your health.","Often, bone spurs don't cause symptoms. You might not know you have bone spurs until an X-ray for another condition reveals the growths. But sometimes, bone spurs can cause pain and loss of motion in your joints. | The symptoms depend on where the bone spurs are. Examples include: | Knee.Bone spurs in the knee can make it painful to extend and bend the leg. | Spine.On the small bones that form the spine, bone spurs can narrow the space that contains the spinal cord. These bone spurs can pinch the spinal cord or its nerve roots. That can cause weakness or numbness in the arms or legs. | Hip.Bone spurs can make it painful to move the hip. Sometimes, it might feel like the pain is in the knee or the thigh. Depending on their placement, bone spurs can reduce the range of motion in the hip joint.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bone-spurs/symptoms-causes/syc-20370212
Osteoporosis,"Osteoporosis causes bones to become weak and brittle — so brittle that a fall or even mild stresses such as bending over or coughing can cause a break. Osteoporosis-related breaks most commonly occur in the hip, wrist or spine.
Bone is living tissue that is constantly being broken down and replaced. Osteoporosis occurs when the creation of new bone doesn't keep up with the loss of old bone.
Osteoporosis affects men and women of all races. But white and Asian women, especially older women who are past menopause, are at highest risk. Medicines, healthy diet and weight-bearing exercise can help prevent bone loss or strengthen already weak bones.","There typically are no symptoms in the early stages of bone loss. But once your bones have been weakened by osteoporosis, you might have signs and symptoms that include: | Back pain, caused by a broken or collapsed bone in the spine. | Loss of height over time. | A stooped posture. | A bone that breaks much more easily than expected.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteoporosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351968

Ovarian cancer,"Ovarian cancer is a growth of cells that forms in the ovaries. The cells multiply quickly and can invade and destroy healthy body tissue.
The female reproductive system contains two ovaries, one on each side of the uterus. The ovaries — each about the size of an almond — produce eggs (ova) as well as the hormones estrogen and progesterone.
Ovarian cancer treatment usually involves surgery and chemotherapy.","When ovarian cancer first develops, it might not cause any noticeable symptoms. When ovarian cancer symptoms happen, they're usually attributed to other, more common conditions. | Signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer may include: | Abdominal bloating or swelling | Quickly feeling full when eating | Weight loss | Discomfort in the pelvic area | Fatigue | Back pain | Changes in bowel habits, such as constipation | A frequent need to urinate",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20375941
Ovarian cysts,"Ovarian cysts are sacs, usually filled with fluid, in an ovary or on its surface. Females have two ovaries. One ovary is located on each side of the uterus.
Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. Eggs develop and mature in the ovaries. Eggs are released in monthly cycles during the childbearing years.
Ovarian cysts are common. Most of the time, you have little or no discomfort, and the cysts are harmless. Most cysts go away without treatment within a few months.
But sometimes ovarian cysts can become twisted or burst open (rupture). This can cause serious symptoms. To protect your health, get regular pelvic exams and know the symptoms that can signal what might be a serious problem.","Most ovarian cysts cause no symptoms and go away on their own. But a large ovarian cyst can cause: | Pelvic pain that may come and go. You may feel a dull ache or a sharp pain in the area below your bellybutton toward one side. | Fullness, pressure or heaviness in your belly (abdomen). | Bloating.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cysts/symptoms-causes/syc-20353405
Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid),"Hyperthyroidism happens when the thyroid gland makes too much thyroid hormone. This condition also is called overactive thyroid. Hyperthyroidism speeds up the body's metabolism. That can cause many symptoms, such as weight loss, hand tremors, and rapid or irregular heartbeat.
Several treatments are available for hyperthyroidism. Anti-thyroid medicines and radioiodine can be used to slow the amount of hormones the thyroid gland makes. Sometimes, hyperthyroidism treatment includes surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid gland. In some cases, depending on what's causing it, hyperthyroidism may improve without medication or other treatment.","Hyperthyroidism sometimes looks like other health problems. That can make it hard to diagnose. It can cause many symptoms, including: | Losing weight without trying. | Fast heartbeat, a condition called tachycardia. | Irregular heartbeat, also called arrhythmia. | Pounding of the heart, sometimes called heart palpitations. | Increased hunger. | Nervousness, anxiety and irritability. | Tremor, usually a small trembling in the hands and fingers. | Sweating. | Changes in menstrual cycles. | Increased sensitivity to heat. | Changes in bowel patterns, especially more-frequent bowel movements. | Enlarged thyroid gland, sometimes called a goiter, which may appear as a swelling at the base of the neck. | Tiredness. | Muscle weakness. | Sleep problems. | Warm, moist skin. | Thinning skin. | Fine, brittle hair. | Older adults are more likely to have symptoms that are hard to notice. These symptoms may include an irregular heartbeat, weight loss, depression, and feeling weak or tired during ordinary activities.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hyperthyroidism/symptoms-causes/syc-20373659

Peripheral artery disease (PAD),"Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a common condition in which narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to the arms or legs.
This condition also may be called peripheral arterial disease.
In PAD, the legs or arms — usually the legs — don't get enough blood flow to keep up with demand. This may cause leg pain when walking, called claudication, and other symptoms.
Peripheral artery disease is usually a sign of a buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries, a condition called atherosclerosis.
Treatment for PAD includes exercising, eating healthy foods, and not smoking or using tobacco.","Peripheral artery disease (PAD) may not cause symptoms, or symptoms may be mild. PAD symptoms include: | Leg pain when walking. | Muscle pain or cramping in the arms or legs, often in the calf. | Muscle pain in the arms or legs that begins with exercise and ends with rest. | Painful cramping in one or both of the hips, thighs or calves after walking or climbing stairs or other activities. | Pain when using the arms, such as aching and cramping when knitting or writing. | Coldness in the lower leg or foot, especially when compared with the other side. | Leg numbness or weakness. | No pulse or a weak pulse in the legs or feet. | The muscle pain in peripheral artery disease may: | Be mild to extreme. | Wake you up from sleep. | Make it hard to walk or exercise. | Occur during rest or when lying down if the condition is severe. | Other symptoms of PAD may include: | Shiny skin on the legs. | Skin color changes on the legs. | Slow-growing toenails. | Sores on the toes, feet or legs that won't heal. | Hair loss or slower hair growth on the legs. | Erectile dysfunction.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peripheral-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350557
Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome,"Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES) is an uncommon condition that affects the main artery behind the knee. That artery is called the popliteal artery. In this condition, the calf muscle is in the wrong position or it's larger than usual. The muscle presses on the artery. The artery becomes trapped, making it harder for blood to flow to the lower leg and foot.
Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome is most common among athletes.","The main symptom of popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES) is pain or cramping in the back of the lower leg. The back of the lower leg is called the calf. The pain occurs during exercise and goes away with rest. Other symptoms may include: | Cold feet after exercise. | Tingling or burning in your calf. | Numbness in the calf area. | If the nearby vein, called the popliteal vein, also becomes trapped by the calf muscle, you may have: | A heavy feeling in the leg. | Lower leg cramping at night. | Swelling in the calf area. | Changes in skin color around the calf muscle. | Blood clot in the lower leg, called deep vein thrombosis. | Symptoms typically affect young, otherwise healthy people under age 40.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/popliteal-artery-entrapment/symptoms-causes/syc-20465211

Back pain,"Back pain is one of the most common reasons people seek medical help or miss work. Back pain is a leading cause of disability worldwide.
Fortunately, measures can help prevent or relieve most back pain episodes, especially for people younger than age 60. If prevention fails, simple home treatment and using the body correctly often can heal the back within a few weeks. Surgery is rarely needed to treat back pain.","Back pain can range from a muscle ache to a shooting, burning or stabbing feeling. Also, the pain can radiate down a leg. Bending, twisting, lifting, standing or walking can make pain worse.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/back-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20369906
Breast pain,"Breast pain (mastalgia) can be described as tenderness, throbbing, sharp, stabbing, burning pain or tightness in the breast tissue. The pain may be constant or it may occur only occasionally, and it can occur in men, women and transgender people.
Breast pain can range from mild to severe. It may occur:
In men, breast pain is most commonly caused by a condition called ""gynecomastia"" (guy-nuh-koh-MAS-tee-uh). This refers to an increase in the amount of breast gland tissue that's caused by an imbalance of the hormones estrogen and testosterone. Gynecomastia can affect one or both breasts, sometimes unevenly.
In transgender women, hormone therapy may cause breast pain. In transgender men, breast pain may be caused by the minimal amount of breast tissue that may remain after a mastectomy.
Most times, breast pain signals a noncancerous (benign) breast condition and rarely indicates breast cancer. Unexplained breast pain that doesn't go away after one or two menstrual cycles, or that persists after menopause, or breast pain that doesn't seem to be related to hormone changes needs to be evaluated.","Breast pain can be cyclic or noncyclic. Cyclic means that the pain occurs on a regular pattern. Noncyclic means that the pain is constant, or that there's not a regular pattern. Each type of breast pain has distinct characteristics.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20350423
Chest pain,"Chest pain is pain or discomfort in the area between the neck and belly. Chest pain may be sharp or dull. It might come and go, or you might always feel the pain. The exact symptoms depend on the cause.
Many different things can cause chest pain. The most life-threatening causes involve the heart or lungs. So it's important to get medical help for an accurate diagnosis.
If you think your chest pain is due to a heart attack, call 911 or your local emergency number right away.",Chest pain symptoms depend on the cause.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chest-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20370838
Knee pain,"Knee pain is a common complaint that affects people of all ages. Knee pain may be the result of an injury, such as a ruptured ligament or torn cartilage. Medical conditions — including arthritis, gout and infections — also can cause knee pain.
Many types of minor knee pain respond well to self-care measures. Physical therapy and knee braces also can help relieve pain. In some cases, however, your knee may require surgical repair.","The location and severity of knee pain may vary, depending on the cause of the problem. Signs and symptoms that sometimes accompany knee pain include: | Swelling and stiffness | Redness and warmth to the touch | Weakness or instability | Popping or crunching noises | Inability to fully straighten the knee",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/knee-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20350849
Neck pain,"Neck pain is common. Poor posture — whether from leaning over a computer or hunching over a workbench — strains neck muscles. Osteoarthritis also is a common cause of neck pain.
Rarely, neck pain can be a symptom of a more serious problem. Seek medical care for neck pain with numbness or loss of strength in the arms or hands or for pain that shoots into a shoulder or down an arm.","Symptoms include: | Pain that's often worsened by holding the head in one place for long periods, such as when driving or working at a computer | Muscle tightness and spasms | Decreased ability to move the head | Headache",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/neck-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20375581
Wrist pain,"Wrist pain is often caused by sprains or fractures from sudden injuries. But wrist pain also can result from long-term problems, such as repetitive stress, arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome.
Because so many factors can lead to wrist pain, diagnosing the exact cause can be difficult. But an accurate diagnosis is essential for proper treatment and healing.","Wrist pain may vary, depending on the cause. For example, osteoarthritis pain often is described as being similar to a dull toothache. Carpal tunnel syndrome usually causes a pins and needles feeling. This tingling sensation often occurs in the thumb and index and middle fingers, especially at night. The precise location of wrist pain also provides clues to what's behind the symptoms.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/wrist-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20366213

Painful intercourse (dyspareunia),"Painful intercourse can happen for reasons that range from structural problems to psychological concerns. Many people have painful intercourse at some point in their lives.
The medical term for painful intercourse is dyspareunia (dis-puh-ROO-nee-uh). It is lasting or recurrent genital pain that occurs just before, during or after sex. Talk with your healthcare professional if you're having painful intercourse. Treatments focus on the cause and can help stop or ease this common problem.","If you have painful intercourse, you might feel: | Pain only at sexual entry, called penetration. | Pain with every penetration, including putting in a tampon. | Deep pain during thrusting. | Burning pain or aching pain. | Throbbing pain lasting hours after sex.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/painful-intercourse/symptoms-causes/syc-20375967

Bell's palsy,"Bell's palsy is a condition that causes sudden weakness in the muscles on one side of the face. Often the weakness is short-term and improves over weeks. The weakness makes half of the face appear to droop. Smiles are one-sided, and the eye on the affected side is hard to close.
Bell's palsy also is known as acute peripheral facial palsy of unknown cause. It can occur at any age. The exact cause is not known. Experts think it's caused by swelling and irritation of the nerve that controls the muscles on one side of the face. Bell's palsy could be caused by a reaction that occurs after a viral infection.
Symptoms usually start to improve within a few weeks, with complete recovery in about six months. A small number of people continue to have some Bell's palsy symptoms for life. Rarely, Bell's palsy occurs more than once.","Symptoms of Bell's palsy come on suddenly and may include: | Mild weakness to total paralysis on one side of the face — occurring within hours to days. | Facial droop and trouble making facial expressions, such as closing an eye or smiling. | Drooling. | Pain around the jaw or pain in or behind the ear on the affected side. | Increased sensitivity to sound on the affected side. | Headache. | Loss of taste. | Changes in the amount of tears and saliva produced. | Rarely, Bell's palsy can affect the nerves on both sides of the face.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bells-palsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20370028
Cerebral palsy,"Cerebral palsy is a group of conditions that affect movement and posture. It's caused by damage that occurs to the developing brain, most often before birth.
Symptoms appear during infancy or preschool years and vary from very mild to serious. Children with cerebral palsy may have exaggerated reflexes. The arms, legs and trunk may appear floppy. Or they may have stiff muscles, known as spasticity. Symptoms also can include irregular posture, movements that can't be controlled, a walk that's not steady or some combination of these.
Cerebral palsy may make it hard to swallow. It also can cause eye muscle imbalance, in which the eyes don't focus on the same object. People with the condition might have reduced range of motion in their joints due to muscle stiffness.
The cause of cerebral palsy and its effect on function vary from person to person. Some people with cerebral palsy can walk while others need assistance. Some people have intellectual disabilities, but others do not. Epilepsy, blindness or deafness also might affect some people with cerebral palsy. There is no cure, but treatments can help improve function. The symptoms of cerebral palsy may vary during the child's development, but the condition doesn't get worse. The condition generally stays the same over time.","Symptoms of cerebral palsy can vary greatly. In some people, cerebral palsy affects the whole body. In other people, symptoms might only affect one or two limbs or one side of the body. General symptoms include trouble with movement and coordination, speech and eating, development, and other issues.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cerebral-palsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20353999
Pancreatitis,"Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. Inflammation is immune system activity that can cause swelling, pain, and changes in how an organ or tissues work.
The pancreas is a long, flat gland that's tucked behind the stomach. The pancreas helps the body digest food and regulates blood sugars.
Pancreatitis can be an acute condition. This means it appears suddenly and generally lasts a short time. Chronic pancreatitis is a long-term condition. The damage to the pancreas can get worse over time.
Acute pancreatitis may improve on its own. More-serious disease requires treatment in a hospital and can cause life-threatening complications.","Symptoms of pancreatitis may vary. Acute pancreatitis symptoms may include: | Pain in the upper belly. | Pain in the upper belly that radiates to the back. | Tenderness when touching the belly. | Fever. | Rapid pulse. | Upset stomach. | Vomiting. | Chronic pancreatitis signs and symptoms include: | Pain in the upper belly. | Belly pain that feels worse after eating. | Losing weight without trying. | Oily, smelly stools. | Some people with chronic pancreatitis only develop symptoms after they get complications of the disease.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20360227
Pancreatic cancer,"Pancreatic cancer is a type of cancer that begins as a growth of cells in the pancreas. The pancreas lies behind the lower part of the stomach. It makes enzymes that help digest food and hormones that help manage blood sugar.
The most common type of pancreatic cancer is pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. This type begins in the cells that line the ducts that carry digestive enzymes out of the pancreas.
Pancreatic cancer rarely is found at its early stages when the chance of curing it is greatest. This is because it often doesn't cause symptoms until after it has spread to other organs.
Your health care team considers the extent of your pancreatic cancer when creating your treatment plan. Treatment options may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy or a mix of these.","Pancreatic cancer often doesn't cause symptoms until the disease is advanced. When they happen, signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer may include: | Belly pain that spreads to the sides or back. | Loss of appetite. | Weight loss. | Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, called jaundice. | Light-colored or floating stools. | Dark-colored urine. | Itching. | New diagnosis of diabetes or diabetes that's getting harder to control. | Pain and swelling in an arm or leg, which might be caused by a blood clot. | Tiredness or weakness.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors,"Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are a rare type of cancer that starts as a growth of cells in the pancreas. The pancreas is a long, flat gland that sits behind the stomach. It makes enzymes and hormones that help digest food.
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors start from the hormone-producing cells in the pancreas. These cells are called islet cells. Another term for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor is islet cell cancer.
Some pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor cells keep making hormones. These are known as functional tumors. Functional tumors create too much of the given hormone. Examples of functional tumors include insulinoma, gastrinoma and glucagonoma.
Most pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors do not produce an excess amount of hormones. Tumors that don't produce extra hormones are called nonfunctional tumors.","Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors sometimes don't cause symptoms. When they do, symptoms can include: | Heartburn. | Weakness. | Fatigue. | Muscle cramps. | Indigestion. | Diarrhea. | Weight loss. | Skin rash. | Constipation. | Pain in the abdomen or back. | Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes. | Dizziness. | Blurred vision. | Headaches. | Increased thirst and hunger.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/symptoms-causes/syc-20352489
Panic attacks and panic disorder,"A panic attack is a sudden episode of intense fear that triggers severe physical reactions when there is no real danger or apparent cause. Panic attacks can be very frightening. When panic attacks occur, you might think you're losing control, having a heart attack or even dying.
Many people have just one or two panic attacks in their lifetimes, and the problem goes away, perhaps when a stressful situation ends. But if you've had recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and spent long periods in constant fear of another attack, you may have a condition called panic disorder.
Although panic attacks themselves aren't life-threatening, they can be frightening and significantly affect your quality of life. But treatment can be very effective.","Panic attacks typically begin suddenly, without warning. They can strike at any time — when you're driving a car, at the mall, sound asleep or in the middle of a business meeting. You may have occasional panic attacks, or they may occur frequently. | Panic attacks have many variations, but symptoms usually peak within minutes. You may feel fatigued and worn out after a panic attack subsides. | Panic attacks typically include some of these signs or symptoms: | Sense of impending doom or danger | Fear of loss of control or death | Rapid, pounding heart rate | Sweating | Trembling or shaking | Shortness of breath or tightness in your throat | Chills | Hot flashes | Nausea | Abdominal cramping | Chest pain | Headache | Dizziness, lightheadedness or faintness | Numbness or tingling sensation | Feeling of unreality or detachment | One of the worst things about panic attacks is the intense fear that you'll have another one. You may fear having panic attacks so much that you avoid certain situations where they may occur.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/panic-attacks/symptoms-causes/syc-20376021
Paraganglioma,"A paraganglioma is a growth of cells that can happen in different places in the body. The growth, called a tumor, forms from an important type of nerve cell that's found throughout the body. Paragangliomas most often start in the head, neck, stomach area or pelvis.
A paraganglioma is rare. And most often, it's not cancer. When a tumor isn't cancer, it's called benign. Sometimes a paraganglioma is cancerous. A cancerous tumor can spread to other parts of the body.
Paragangliomas often don't have a clear cause. Some paragangliomas are caused by DNA changes that pass from parents to children.
Paragangliomas can form at any age. Healthcare professionals most often find them in adults between the ages of 20 and 50.
Paraganglioma treatment typically involves surgery to remove the tumor. If the paraganglioma is cancerous and spreads to other areas of the body, more treatments may be needed.","Paraganglioma symptoms may depend on where the tumor starts. Paragangliomas most often start in the head, neck, stomach area or pelvis. | Symptoms of a paraganglioma in the head or neck can include: | A rhythmic pulsing or whooshing sound in the ears, called pulsatile tinnitus. | Trouble swallowing. | Hoarse voice. | Hearing loss. | Blurred vision. | Dizziness. | Symptoms of a paraganglioma in the head and neck area might happen as the tumor grows larger. The tumor can press on nearby structures. | When paragangliomas form in other places in the body, the symptoms are more likely to be caused by hormones that the paraganglioma makes. The hormones, called catecholamines, play a role in how the body response to stress. They include adrenaline, also known as the fight-or-flight hormone. | Symptoms of paragangliomas that make hormones include: | High blood pressure. | Feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart. | The sudden loss of color in the face. | Sweating. | Headache. | Uncontrolled shaking in the hands or arms. | General weakness. | These symptoms may come and go. | Some people with paragangliomas don't have any symptoms.

Paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system,"Paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system are a group of rare conditions that develop in some people who have cancer. In addition to the nervous system, paraneoplastic syndromes also can affect other organ systems including hormones, skin, blood and joints.
Paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system occur when cancer-fighting agents of the immune system also attack parts of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves or muscle.
Depending on where the nervous system is affected, paraneoplastic syndromes can affect muscle movement, coordination, sensory perception, memory, thinking skills or even sleep.
Sometimes the injury to the nervous system can be reversed with therapy directed toward the cancer and the immune system. But sometimes paraneoplastic syndromes can result in permanent damage to the nervous system.
Treating the cancer and other therapies may prevent further damage and improve symptoms and quality of life.","Symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system can develop relatively quickly, often over days to weeks.

Parkinson's disease,"Parkinson's disease is a movement disorder of the nervous system that worsens over time. The nervous system is a network of nerve cells that controls many parts of the body, including movement.
Symptoms start slowly. The first symptom may be a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand or sometimes a foot or the jaw. Tremor is common in Parkinson's disease. But the disorder also may cause stiffness, slowing of movement and trouble with balance that raises the risk of falls.
In the early stages of Parkinson's disease, your face may show little or no expression. Your arms may not swing when you walk. Your speech may become soft or slurred. Symptoms get worse over time.
Although Parkinson's disease can't be cured, medicines may help symptoms get better. Sometimes a healthcare professional may suggest surgery to help control parts of the brain. This surgery may help lessen symptoms.","Parkinson's disease symptoms can be different for everyone. Early symptoms may be mild, and you may not even notice them. Symptoms often begin on one side of the body, then affect both sides. Symptoms are usually worse on one side than the other. Some Parkinson's disease symptoms are similar to those of other disorders. | Parkinson's symptoms may include: | Tremor.This rhythmic shaking usually begins in the hands or fingers. Sometimes tremor begins in the foot or jaw. You may rub your thumb and forefinger back and forth. This is known as a pill-rolling tremor. Your hand may tremble when it's at rest or when you're under stress. You may notice that you shake less when you're doing some sort of task or moving around. | Slowed movement, also called bradykinesia.Parkinson's disease may slow your movement, making simple tasks more difficult. It may be hard to get out of a chair, shower or get dressed. You may have less expression in your face. It may be hard to blink. | Rigid muscles.You may have stiff muscles in any part of your body. Your muscles may feel tense and painful, and your arm movements may be short and jerky. | Poor posture and balance.Your posture may become stooped. You may fall or have balance problems. | Loss of automatic movements.You may be less able to make certain movements that you typically do without thinking, including blinking, smiling or swinging your arms when you walk. | Speech changes.You may speak softly or quickly, slur, or hesitate before talking. Your speech may be flat or monotone, without typical speech patterns. | Writing changes.You may have trouble writing, and your writing may appear cramped and small. | Nonmotor symptoms.These may include depression, anxiety, constipation and sleep problems. They also may include acting out dreams, needing to urinate often, trouble smelling, problems with thinking and memory, and feeling very tired.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/parkinsons-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20376055
Parotid tumors,"Parotid tumors are growths of cells that start in the parotid glands. The parotid glands are two salivary glands that sit just in front of the ears. There is one on each side of the face. Salivary glands make saliva to help with chewing and digesting food.
There are many salivary glands in the lips, cheeks, mouth and throat. Growths of cells, which are called tumors, can happen in any of these glands. The parotid glands are the most common place that salivary gland tumors happen.
Most parotid tumors aren't cancerous. These are called noncancerous or benign parotid tumors. Sometimes the tumors are cancers. These are called malignant parotid tumors or parotid gland cancers.
Parotid tumors often cause swelling in the face or jaw. Other symptoms include problems swallowing or a loss of facial movement.
Diagnosis and treatment for parotid tumors is often done by doctors who specialize in problems that affect the ear, nose and throat. These doctors are called ENT specialists or otolaryngologists.",Signs and symptoms of parotid tumors include: | A lump or swelling on one side of the face that might appear near the ear or cheek. | Trouble swallowing. | Trouble opening the mouth widely. | Numbness in part of the face. | Muscle weakness in part of the face. | Pain in the face.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/parotid-tumor/symptoms-causes/syc-20578986

Patellofemoral pain syndrome is sometimes called runner's knee. It's more common in people who run and who play sports that involve running and jumping.
The knee pain often increases when running, walking up or down stairs, sitting for long periods, or squatting. Simple treatments, such as rest and ice, often help. But sometimes patellofemoral pain needs physical therapy.","Patellofemoral pain syndrome usually causes a dull, aching pain in the front of the knee.

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA),"Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a persistent opening between the two major blood vessels leading from the heart.
An opening called the ductus arteriosus is part of the blood flow system in the womb for an unborn baby, also called a fetus. It usually closes shortly after birth. If the opening remains open, it's called a patent ductus arteriosus. APDAis a type of congenital heart defect.
A smallPDAmight never need treatment. But a large, untreated patent ductus arteriosus can let oxygen-poor blood move the wrong way. This can make the heart muscle weak, causing heart failure and other complications.
Treatments for patent ductus arteriosus may include regular health checkups, medicines, and a procedure or surgery to close the opening.","Patent ductus arteriosus symptoms (PDA) depend on the size of the opening and the person's age.

Kleptomania,"Kleptomania (klep-toe-MAY-nee-uh) is a mental health disorder that involves repeatedly being unable to resist urges to steal items that you generally don't really need. Often the items stolen have little value and you could afford to buy them. Kleptomania is rare but can be a serious condition. It can cause much emotional pain to you and your loved ones — and even legal problems — if not treated.
Kleptomania is a type of impulse control disorder — a disorder that involves problems with emotional or behavioral self-control. If you have an impulse control disorder, you have difficulty resisting the temptation or powerful urge to perform an act that's excessive or harmful to you or someone else.
Many people with kleptomania live lives of secret shame because they're afraid to seek mental health treatment. Although there's no cure for kleptomania, treatment with medicine or skill-building therapy that focuses on dealing with urges may help to end the cycle of compulsive stealing.","Kleptomania symptoms may include: | Inability to resist powerful urges to steal items that you don't need | Feeling increased tension, anxiety or arousal leading up to the theft | Feeling pleasure, relief or satisfaction while stealing | Feeling terrible guilt, remorse, self-loathing, shame or fear of arrest after the theft | Return of the urges and a repetition of the kleptomania cycle",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kleptomania/symptoms-causes/syc-20364732
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a problem with hormones that happens during the reproductive years. If you havePCOS, you may not have periods very often. Or you may have periods that last many days. You may also have too much of a hormone called androgen in your body.
WithPCOS, many small sacs of fluid develop along the outer edge of the ovary. These are called cysts. The small fluid-filled cysts contain immature eggs. These are called follicles. The follicles fail to regularly release eggs.
The exact cause ofPCOSis unknown. Early diagnosis and treatment along with weight loss may lower the risk of long-term complications such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease.","Symptoms ofPCOSoften start around the time of the first menstrual period. Sometimes symptoms develop later after you have had periods for a while. | The symptoms ofPCOSvary. A diagnosis ofPCOSis made when you have at least two of these: | Irregular periods.Having few menstrual periods or having periods that aren't regular are common signs ofPCOS. So is having periods that last for many days or longer than is typical for a period. For example, you might have fewer than nine periods a year. And those periods may occur more than 35 days apart. You may have trouble getting pregnant. | Too much androgen.High levels of the hormone androgen may result in excess facial and body hair. This is called hirsutism. Sometimes, severe acne and male-pattern baldness can happen, too. | Polycystic ovaries.Your ovaries might be bigger. Many follicles containing immature eggs may develop around the edge of the ovary.

Peanut allergy,"Peanut allergy is a condition that causes the body's germ-fighting immune system to react to peanuts. It's one of the most common causes of a life-threatening allergic reaction to food. This life-threatening reaction is known as anaphylaxis.
Peanut allergy has been increasing in children. Even if you or your child has shown only a mild reaction to peanuts, it's important to talk to a healthcare professional. There is still a risk of a more serious future reaction.","An allergic response to peanuts usually occurs within minutes after exposure. Peanut allergy signs and symptoms can include: | Skin reactions, such as hives, redness or swelling. | Itching or tingling in or around the mouth and throat. | Digestive problems, such as diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea or vomiting. | Tightening of the throat. | Shortness of breath or wheezing. | Runny nose.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peanut-allergy/symptoms-causes/syc-20376175
Pectus excavatum,"Pectus excavatum is a condition in which the breastbone is sunken into the chest. The sunken breastbone often can be seen shortly after birth. If the breastbone sinks a lot over time, the center of the chest may look like it's been scooped out. This change leaves a deep dent or dip. But many people with the condition just have a slight dip in the breastbone.
This condition also is known as funnel chest. But it can affect much more than the look of the chest. It also can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, and a fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart. The symptoms tend to become worse during the teenage growth spurt.
The exact cause of pectus excavatum isn't clear. When the condition is serious, it can affect how well the heart and lungs work over time. But even mild pectus excavatum that causes a slight dip in the breastbone can make children feel self-conscious about their bodies.
Surgery to repair pectus excavatum can improve symptoms and the appearance of the chest. But surgery isn't right for everyone with the condition. Other treatment choices may include physical therapy and medical devices.","For many people with pectus excavatum, the only symptom is a slight dip in their chests. In some children, the dip becomes deeper during early puberty. It can keep getting deeper into adulthood. | In people with pectus excavatum, the breastbone may compress the lungs and heart.

Pediatric brain tumors,"Pediatric brain tumors are growths of cells that start in or near the brain in children. The growths, called tumors, can grow to press on nearby parts of the brain. This can cause symptoms, such as headaches and nausea.
Many types of pediatric brain tumors exist. Some grow quickly, and some grow slowly. Some are cancerous, and some aren't cancerous. Noncancerous brain tumors also are called benign brain tumors.
The type of brain tumor a child has helps determine the best treatment plan. Other things your child's healthcare team considers include the tumor's location, whether it has spread beyond the brain, and your child's age and overall health.
Treatment for brain tumors in children is often quite different from treatment for adult brain tumors. For this reason, seek out care at a medical center that has experience caring for children with brain tumors.","Pediatric brain tumor symptoms may vary depending on the tumor's location within the brain. Symptoms also might depend on the size of the tumor and how quickly it's growing. | Some of the more common signs and symptoms of pediatric brain tumors include: | Headaches, which may become more frequent and more severe. In children who don't talk, a parent might notice that the child is more irritable than usual. | Nausea and vomiting. | Vision changes, such as double vision.

Pelvic organ prolapse,"Pelvic organ prolapse is when one or more pelvic organs drop from their position. This makes a bulge in the vagina, called a prolapse.
The muscles and connective tissues of the pelvic floor typically hold the pelvic organs in place. Pelvic organs include the vagina, bladder, uterus, urethra and rectum. Pelvic organ prolapse happens when the muscles and tissues of the pelvic floor weaken. This may be due to pregnancy, childbirth or menopause.
Pelvic organ prolapse can be treated. Often, nonsurgical treatment helps. Sometimes, surgery might be needed to put the pelvic organs back in place.","Sometimes, pelvic organ prolapse has no symptoms. When symptoms happen, they might include: | Seeing or feeling a bulge of tissue at or beyond the opening of the vagina. | Pelvic pressure, heaviness or pain. | Lower back pain. | Not being able to keep in a tampon. | Urinary changes. These might include urinating more, feeling an urgent need to urinate, not being able to empty the bladder all the way or having a weak urine stream. | Bowel changes, such as not emptying stool all the way or having to put fingers in the vagina to support the bulge to be able to pass stool. This is called splinting. | Sexual issues, such as pain with sex. | Weakness of the pelvic floor often affects more than one area. For instance, if one of your pelvic organs is prolapsed, you're more likely to have another type of pelvic organ prolapse.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pelvic-organ-prolapse/symptoms-causes/syc-20360557
Chronic pelvic pain,"Chronic pelvic pain is pain in the area below the bellybutton and between the hips that lasts six months or longer.
Chronic pelvic pain can have more than one cause. It may be a symptom of another disease, or it can be a condition in its own right.
If chronic pelvic pain seems to be caused by another health condition, treating that problem may get rid of the pain.
But tests may not be able to find a cause for chronic pelvic pain. In that case, the goal of treatment is to ease pain and other symptoms. That could make your quality of life better.","You may feel chronic pelvic pain in different parts of your pelvic area, rather than in just one spot. You might describe the pain in one or more of the following ways: | Serious and steady. | Pain that comes and goes. | Dull aching. | Sharp pains or cramping. | Pressure or heaviness deep within the pelvis. | The pain also may happen: | During sex. | While having a bowel movement or urinating. | When you sit or stand for a long time. | Chronic pelvic pain may be mild. Or it may be so intense that you miss work and can't sleep or exercise. | Other symptoms can include: | An urgent or frequent need to urinate. | Bloating. | Upset stomach. | Constipation or diarrhea.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-pelvic-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20354368
Uterine prolapse,"Uterine prolapse occurs when pelvic floor muscles and ligaments stretch and weaken until they no longer provide enough support for the uterus. As a result, the uterus slips down into or protrudes out of the vagina.
Uterine prolapse most often affects people after menopause who've had one or more vaginal deliveries.
Mild uterine prolapse usually doesn't require treatment. But uterine prolapse that causes discomfort or disrupts daily life might benefit from treatment.","Mild uterine prolapse is common after childbirth. It generally doesn't cause symptoms. Symptoms of moderate to severe uterine prolapse include: | Seeing or feeling tissue bulge out of the vagina | Feeling heaviness or pulling in the pelvis | Feeling like the bladder doesn't empty all the way when you use the bathroom | Problems with leaking urine, also called incontinence | Trouble having a bowel movement and needing to press the vagina with your fingers to help have a bowel movement | Feeling as if you're sitting on a small ball | Feeling as if you have vaginal tissue rubbing on clothing | Pressure or discomfort in the pelvis or low back | Sexual concerns, such as feeling as though the vaginal tissue is loose",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/uterine-prolapse/symptoms-causes/syc-20353458
Pemphigus,"Pemphigus is a group of rare skin disorders that cause blisters and sores on the skin or mucous membranes, such as in the mouth or on the genitals. It's most common in people middle-aged or older.
Pemphigus is easier to control if caught and treated early. It's usually treated with medicines that you take long term. The sores may heal slowly or not at all. The condition can become life-threatening if the sores become infected.","Pemphigus causes blisters on the skin and mucous membranes. The blisters break easily, leaving open sores. The sores may become infected and ooze. | The symptoms of two common types of pemphigus are as follows: | Pemphigus vulgaris.This type usually begins with blisters in the mouth and then on the skin or genital mucous membranes. They're often painful but don't itch. Blisters in the mouth or throat may make it hard to talk, drink and eat. | Pemphigus foliaceus.This type causes blisters on the chest, back and shoulders.

Peptic ulcers include:
The most common causes of peptic ulcers are infection with the germ Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve).
Stress and spicy foods do not cause peptic ulcers. But they can make symptoms worse.","Many people with peptic ulcers don't have symptoms.

Pericarditis,"Pericarditis is swelling and irritation of the thin, saclike tissue surrounding the heart. This tissue is called the pericardium. Pericarditis often causes sharp chest pain. The chest pain occurs when the irritated layers of the pericardium rub against each other.
Pericarditis often is mild. It may go away without treatment. Treatment for more-serious symptoms can include medicines and, very rarely, surgery. When healthcare professionals find and treat pericarditis early, that may help lower the risk of long-term complications from pericarditis.","Chest pain is the most common symptom of pericarditis. It usually feels sharp or stabbing. But some people have dull, achy or pressure-like chest pain. | Most often, pericarditis pain is felt behind the breastbone or on the left side of the chest. The pain may: | Spread to the left shoulder and neck, or to both shoulders. | Get worse when coughing, lying down or taking a deep breath. | Get better when sitting up or leaning forward. | Other symptoms of pericarditis can include: | Cough. | Fatigue or general feeling of weakness or being sick. | Swelling of the legs or feet. | Low-grade fever. | Pounding or racing heartbeat, also called heart palpitations. | Shortness of breath when lying down. | Swelling of the belly, also called the abdomen. | The specific symptoms depend on the type of pericarditis. Pericarditis is grouped into different categories, according to the pattern of symptoms and how long symptoms last. | Acute pericarditisbegins suddenly but doesn't last longer than four weeks. Future episodes can occur. It may be hard to tell the difference between acute pericarditis and pain due to a heart attack. | Recurrent pericarditisoccurs about 4 to 6 weeks after a bout of acute pericarditis. No symptoms happen in between. | Incessant pericarditislasts about 4 to 6 weeks but less than three months. The symptoms continue over this whole time. | Chronic constrictive pericarditisusually develops slowly and lasts longer than three months.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pericarditis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352510
Perimenopause,"Perimenopause means ""around menopause"" and refers to the time during which your body makes the natural transition to menopause, marking the end of the reproductive years. Perimenopause is also called the menopausal transition.
Women start perimenopause at different ages. You may notice signs of progression toward menopause, such as menstrual irregularity, sometime in your 40s. But some women notice changes as early as their mid-30s.
The level of estrogen — the main female hormone — in your body rises and falls unevenly during perimenopause. Your menstrual cycles may lengthen or shorten, and you may begin having menstrual cycles in which your ovaries don't release an egg (ovulate). You may also experience menopause-like symptoms, such as hot flashes, sleep problems and vaginal dryness. Treatments are available to help ease these symptoms.
Once you've gone through 12 consecutive months without a menstrual period, you've officially reached menopause, and the perimenopause period is over.","Throughout the menopausal transition, some subtle — and some not-so-subtle — changes in your body may take place. You might experience: | Irregular periods.As ovulation becomes more unpredictable, the length of time between periods may be longer or shorter, your flow may be light to heavy, and you may skip some periods. If you have a persistent change of seven days or more in the length of your menstrual cycle, you may be in early perimenopause. If you have a space of 60 days or more between periods, you're likely in late perimenopause. | Hot flashes and sleep problems.Hot flashes are common during perimenopause. The intensity, length and frequency vary. Sleep problems are often due to hot flashes or night sweats, but sometimes sleep becomes unpredictable even without them. | Mood changes.Mood swings, irritability or increased risk of depression may happen during perimenopause. The cause of these symptoms may be sleep disruption associated with hot flashes. Mood changes may also be caused by factors not related to the hormonal changes of perimenopause. | Vaginal and bladder problems.When estrogen levels diminish, your vaginal tissues may lose lubrication and elasticity, making intercourse painful. Low estrogen may also leave you more vulnerable to urinary or vaginal infections. Loss of tissue tone may contribute to urinary incontinence. | Decreasing fertility.As ovulation becomes irregular, your ability to conceive decreases. However, as long as you're having periods, pregnancy is still possible. If you wish to avoid pregnancy, use birth control until you've had no periods for 12 months. | Changes in sexual function.During perimenopause, sexual arousal and desire may change. But if you had satisfactory sexual intimacy before menopause, this will likely continue through perimenopause and beyond. | Loss of bone.With declining estrogen levels, you start to lose bone more quickly than you replace it, increasing your risk of osteoporosis — a disease that causes fragile bones. | Changing cholesterol levels.Declining estrogen levels may lead to unfavorable changes in your blood cholesterol levels, including an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol — the ""bad"" cholesterol — which contributes to an increased risk of heart disease. At the same time, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol — the ""good"" cholesterol — decreases in many women as they age, which also increases the risk of heart disease.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/perimenopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20354666
Gingivitis,"Gingivitis is a common and mild form of gum disease, also called periodontal disease. It causes irritation, redness, swelling and bleeding of your gingiva, which is the part of your gum around the base of your teeth. It's important to take gingivitis seriously and treat it promptly. Gingivitis does not cause bone loss. But left untreated, it can lead to a much more serious gum disease, called periodontitis, and tooth loss.
The most common cause of gingivitis is not keeping your teeth and gums clean and healthy. Good oral health habits, such as brushing at least twice a day, flossing daily and getting regular dental checkups, can help prevent and reverse gingivitis.","Healthy gums are firm and pale pink. They fit tightly around the teeth. Symptoms of gingivitis include: | Swollen or puffy gums. | Bright red or dark red gums, or gums that are darker than usual. | Gums that bleed easily when you brush or floss. | Tender gums. | Bad breath.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gingivitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354453
Periodontitis,"Periodontitis (per-e-o-don-TIE-tis), also called gum disease, is a serious gum infection that damages the soft tissue around teeth. Without treatment, periodontitis can destroy the bone that supports your teeth. This can cause teeth to loosen or lead to tooth loss.
Periodontitis is common but can usually be prevented. It's often the result of not taking care of your mouth and teeth. To help prevent periodontitis or improve your chance of successful treatment, brush at least twice a day, floss daily and get regular dental checkups.","Healthy gums are firm and fit snugly around teeth. The color of healthy gums can vary. They may range from light pink in some people to dark pink and brown in others. | Symptoms of periodontitis can include: | Swollen or puffy gums. | Bright red, dark red or dark purple gums. | Gums that feel tender when touched. | Gums that bleed easily. | A toothbrush that looks pink after brushing your teeth. | Spitting out blood when brushing or flossing your teeth. | Bad breath that won't go away. | Pus between your teeth and gums. | Loose teeth or loss of teeth. | Painful chewing. | New spaces that develop between your teeth that look like black triangles. | Gums that pull away from your teeth, making your teeth look longer than usual, called receding gums. | A change in the way your teeth fit together when you bite.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/periodontitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354473
Peripheral nerve injuries,"Peripheral nerves send messages from the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. They help do things such as move the body's muscles for walking and sense that the feet are cold. Peripheral nerves are made of fibers called axons that are insulated by surrounding tissues.
Peripheral nerves are fragile and easily damaged. A nerve injury can affect the brain's ability to communicate with muscles and organs. Damage to the peripheral nerves is called peripheral neuropathy.
It's important to get medical care for a peripheral nerve injury as soon as possible. Early diagnosis and treatment may prevent complications and permanent damage.","With a peripheral nerve injury, symptoms may range from mild to serious, limiting your daily activities. Your symptoms often depend on which nerve fibers are damaged: | Motor nerves.These nerves regulate all the muscles under your conscious control, such as those used for walking, talking and holding objects. Damage to these nerves can cause muscle weakness, painful cramps and muscle twitching. | Sensory nerves.Because these nerves relay information about touch, temperature and pain, you may experience a variety of symptoms. These include numbness or tingling in the hands or feet. You may have trouble walking, keeping your balance with your eyes closed, fastening buttons, or sensing pain or changes in temperature. Injury of sensory nerves also may cause pain. | Autonomic (aw-tuh-NOM-ik) nerves.This group of nerves regulates activities that are not controlled consciously, such as breathing, heart and thyroid function, and digestion. Symptoms may include excessive sweating, changes in blood pressure, the inability to tolerate heat and gastrointestinal symptoms. | Many peripheral nerve injuries affect more than one type of nerve fiber, so you may experience a range of symptoms.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peripheral-nerve-injuries/symptoms-causes/syc-20355631
Neurofibromatosis type 1,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic condition that causes changes in skin pigment and tumors on nerve tissue. Skin changes include flat, light brown spots and freckles in the armpits and groin. Tumors can grow anywhere in the nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord and nerves. NF1 is rare. About 1 in 2,500 is affected by NF1.
The tumors often are not cancerous, known as benign tumors. But sometimes they can become cancerous. Symptoms often are mild. But complications can occur and may include trouble with learning, heart and blood vessel conditions, vision loss, and pain.
Treatment focuses on supporting healthy growth and development in children and early management of complications. If NF1 causes large tumors or tumors that press on a nerve, surgery can reduce symptoms. A newer medicine is available to treat tumors in children, and other new treatments are being developed.","Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) usually is diagnosed during childhood. Symptoms are seen at birth or shortly afterward and almost always by age 10. Symptoms tend to be mild to moderate, but they can vary from person to person. | Symptoms include: | Flat, light brown spots on the skin, known as cafe au lait spots.These harmless spots are common in many people. But having more than six cafe au lait spots suggests NF1. They often are present at birth or appear during the first years of life. After childhood, new spots stop appearing. | Freckling in the armpits or groin area.Freckling often appears by ages 3 to 5. Freckles are smaller than cafe au lait spots and tend to occur in clusters in skin folds. | Tiny bumps on the iris of the eye, known as Lisch nodules.These nodules can't easily be seen and don't affect vision. | Soft, pea-sized bumps on or under the skin called neurofibromas.These benign tumors usually grow in or under the skin but can also grow inside the body. A growth that involves many nerves is called a plexiform neurofibroma. Plexiform neurofibromas, when located on the face, can cause disfigurement. Neurofibromas may increase in number with age. | Bone changes.Changes in bone development and low bone mineral density can cause bones to form in an irregular way. People with NF1 may have a curved spine, known as scoliosis, or a bowed lower leg. | Tumor on the nerve that connects the eye to the brain, called an optic pathway glioma.This tumor usually appears by age 3. The tumor rarely appears in late childhood and among teenagers, and almost never in adults. | Learning disabilities.It's common for children with NF1 to have some trouble with learning. Often there is a specific learning disability, such as trouble with reading or math. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and speech delay also are common. | Larger than average head size.Children with NF1 tend to have a larger than average head size due to increased brain volume. | Short stature.Children who have NF1 often are below average in height.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/neurofibromatosis-type-1/symptoms-causes/syc-20350490
Peripheral neuropathy,"Peripheral neuropathy happens when the nerves that are located outside of the brain and spinal cord (peripheral nerves) are damaged. This condition often causes weakness, numbness and pain, usually in the hands and feet. It also can affect other areas and body functions including digestion and urination.
The peripheral nervous system sends information from the brain and spinal cord, also called the central nervous system, to the rest of the body through motor nerves. The peripheral nerves also send sensory information to the central nervous system through sensory nerves.
Peripheral neuropathy can result from traumatic injuries, infections, metabolic problems, inherited causes and exposure to toxins. One of the most common causes of neuropathy is diabetes.
People with peripheral neuropathy usually describe the pain as stabbing, burning or tingling. Sometimes symptoms get better, especially if caused by a condition that can be treated. Medicines can reduce the pain of peripheral neuropathy.","Every nerve in the peripheral system has a specific job. Symptoms depend on the type of nerves affected. Nerves are divided into: | Sensory nerves that receive sensation, such as temperature, pain, vibration or touch, from the skin. | Motor nerves that control muscle movement. | Autonomic nerves that control functions such as blood pressure, sweating, heart rate, digestion and bladder function. | Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy might include: | Gradual onset of numbness, prickling, or tingling in your feet or hands. These sensations can spread upward into your legs and arms. | Sharp, jabbing, throbbing or burning pain. | Extreme sensitivity to touch. | Pain during activities that shouldn't cause pain, such as pain in your feet when putting weight on them or when they're under a blanket. | Lack of coordination and falling. | Muscle weakness. | Feeling as if you're wearing gloves or socks when you're not. | Inability to move if motor nerves are affected. | If autonomic nerves are affected, symptoms might include: | Heat intolerance. | Excessive sweating or not being able to sweat. | Bowel, bladder or digestive problems. | Drops in blood pressure, causing dizziness or lightheadedness. | Peripheral neuropathy can affect one nerve, called mononeuropathy. If it affects two or more nerves in different areas, it's called multiple mononeuropathy, and if it affects many nerves, it's called polyneuropathy. Carpal tunnel syndrome is an example of mononeuropathy. Most people with peripheral neuropathy have polyneuropathy.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peripheral-neuropathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20352061
Peritonitis,"Peritonitis is a serious condition that starts in the abdomen. That's the area of the body between the chest and the pelvis. Peritonitis happens when the thin layer of tissue inside the abdomen becomes inflamed. The tissue layer is called the peritoneum. Peritonitis usually happens due to an infection from bacteria or fungi.
There are two types of peritonitis:
It's important to get treatment fast for peritonitis. Health care providers have ways to clear out the infection. They also can treat any medical problem that might be causing it. Peritonitis treatment usually involves medicines that are used for infections caused by bacteria, called antibiotics. Some people with peritonitis need surgery. If you don't get treatment, peritonitis can lead to a serious infection that spreads through the body. It can be deadly.
A common cause of peritonitis is a treatment for kidney failure called peritoneal dialysis. This treatment helps get rid of waste products from the blood when the kidneys struggle to do that job themselves. If you get peritoneal dialysis, you can help prevent peritonitis with good hygiene before, during and after dialysis. For example, it's important to wash your hands and clean the skin around your catheter.","Symptoms of peritonitis include: | Belly pain or tenderness. | Bloating or a feeling of fullness in the abdomen. | Fever. | Upset stomach and vomiting. | Loss of appetite. | Diarrhea. | Reduced urine. | Thirst. | Not able to pass stool or gas. | Feeling tired. | Confusion. | If you get peritoneal dialysis, peritonitis symptoms also may include: | Cloudy dialysis fluid. | White flecks, strands or clumps — which are called fibrin — in the dialysis fluid.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peritonitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20376247

Chilblains,"Chilblains (CHILL-blayns) is a condition that causes inflamed swollen patches and blistering on the hands and feet. It's caused by exposure to damp air that's cold but not freezing. Symptoms may show up a few hours after being in the cold.
Chilblains can be prevented by limiting your time in the cold, dressing warmly and covering exposed skin. If you do get chilblains, keeping the skin warm and dry can help ease the symptoms.
Chilblains, also known as perniosis, usually clears up in 2 or 3 weeks, especially if the weather gets warmer. You may get the symptoms each cold season for years.
The condition doesn't usually result in permanent injury.","Symptoms of chilblains include: | Small, itchy areas on your skin, often on your feet or hands. | Sores or blistering. | Swelling. | Pain or stinging. | Changes in skin color.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chilblains/symptoms-causes/syc-20351097

Persistent depressive disorder,"Persistent depressive disorder is a continuous, long-term form of depression. You may feel sad and empty, lose interest in daily activities and have trouble getting things done. You may also have low self-esteem, feel like a failure and feel hopeless. These feelings last for years and may interfere with your relationships, school, work and daily activities.
If you have persistent depressive disorder, you may find it hard to be upbeat even on happy occasions. You may be described as having a gloomy personality, constantly complaining or not able to have fun. Persistent depressive disorder is not as severe as major depression, but your current depressed mood may be mild, moderate or severe.
Because persistent depressive disorder is long term, coping with depression symptoms can be challenging. A combination of talk therapy and medicine can be effective in treating this condition.","Persistent depressive disorder symptoms usually come and go over a period of years. The intensity of symptoms can change over time. But symptoms usually don't disappear for more than two months at a time. Also, major depression episodes may occur before or during persistent depressive disorder. | Symptoms of persistent depressive disorder can cause major problems in your life and may include: | Sadness, emptiness or feeling down. | Loss of interest in daily activities. | Tiredness and lack of energy. | Low self-esteem, self-criticism or feeling you're not capable. | Trouble focusing clearly and trouble making decisions. | Problems getting things done well and on time. | Quickly becoming annoyed, impatient or angry. | Avoidance of social activities. | Feelings of guilt and worries over the past. | Poor appetite or overeating. | Sleep problems. | Hopelessness. | In children, symptoms of persistent depressive disorder may include depressed mood and being irritable, which means easily becoming annoyed, impatient or angry.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/persistent-depressive-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20350929
Persistent post-concussive symptoms (Post-concussion syndrome),"Persistent post-concussive symptoms are symptoms of a mild traumatic brain injury that typically last longer than three months. Persistent post-concussive symptoms also are called post-concussion syndrome. The symptoms may include headaches, dizziness, and trouble with concentration and memory. Symptoms can last weeks to months.
A mild traumatic brain injury is known as a concussion. A concussion may be caused by a fall, car accident or contact sports injury. Other causes include violent shaking and movement of the head or body.
You don't have to lose consciousness to get a concussion. And a concussion doesn't always cause persistent post-concussive symptoms. The risk of having persistent post-concussive symptoms doesn't appear to be linked to how severe the injury was.
Persistent post-concussive symptoms in most people appear within the first 7 to 10 days after an injury and typically last longer than three months. But sometimes they can last for a year or more. The goal of treatment is to manage symptoms and to improve functioning and quality of life.","Persistent post-concussive symptoms can be different in each person. They may include: | Headaches. | Dizziness. | Fatigue. | Irritability. | Anxiety. | Depression. | Trouble falling asleep or sleeping too much. | Poor concentration and memory. | Ringing in the ears. | Blurry vision. | Noise and light sensitivity. | Nausea or vomiting. | Neck pain. | Headaches after a concussion most often feel like migraines. The headaches also might feel like tension-type headaches, which may be related to a neck injury that happened at the same time as the head injury.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/post-concussion-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20353352
Antisocial personality disorder,"Antisocial personality disorder, sometimes called sociopathy, is a mental health condition in which a person consistently shows no regard for right and wrong and ignores the rights and feelings of others. People with antisocial personality disorder tend to purposely make others angry or upset and manipulate or treat others harshly or with cruel indifference. They lack remorse or do not regret their behavior.
People with antisocial personality disorder often violate the law, becoming criminals. They may lie, behave violently or impulsively, and have problems with drug and alcohol use. They have difficulty consistently meeting responsibilities related to family, work or school.","Symptoms of antisocial personality disorder include repeatedly: | Ignoring right and wrong. | Telling lies to take advantage of others. | Not being sensitive to or respectful of others. | Using charm or wit to manipulate others for personal gain or pleasure. | Having a sense of superiority and being extremely opinionated. | Having problems with the law, including criminal behavior. | Being hostile, aggressive, violent or threatening to others. | Feeling no guilt about harming others. | Doing dangerous things with no regard for the safety of self or others. | Being irresponsible and failing to fulfill work or financial responsibilities. | Adults with antisocial personality disorder usually show symptoms of conduct disorder before the age of 15. Symptoms of conduct disorder include serious, ongoing behavior problems, such as: | Aggression toward people and animals. | Destruction of property. | Lying and dishonesty. | Theft. | Serious violation of rules. | Antisocial personality disorder is considered a lifelong condition. But in some people, certain symptoms ― particularly destructive and criminal behavior ― may decrease over time. It's not clear whether this decrease is a result of the effect aging has on their mind and body, an increased awareness of the impact that antisocial behavior has had on their life, or other factors.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20353928
Borderline personality disorder,"Borderline personality disorder is a mental health condition that affects the way people feel about themselves and others, making it hard to function in everyday life. It includes a pattern of unstable, intense relationships, as well as impulsiveness and an unhealthy way of seeing themselves. Impulsiveness involves having extreme emotions and acting or doing things without thinking about them first.
People with borderline personality disorder have a strong fear of abandonment or being left alone. Even though they want to have loving and lasting relationships, the fear of being abandoned often leads to mood swings and anger. It also leads to impulsiveness and self-injury that may push others away.
Borderline personality disorder usually begins by early adulthood. The condition is most serious in young adulthood. Mood swings, anger and impulsiveness often get better with age. But the main issues of self-image and fear of being abandoned, as well as relationship issues, go on.
If you have borderline personality disorder, know that many people with this condition get better with treatment. They can learn to live stabler, more-fulfilling lives.","Borderline personality disorder affects how you feel about yourself, relate to others and behave. | Symptoms may include: | A strong fear of abandonment. This includes going to extreme measures so you're not separated or rejected, even if these fears are made up. | A pattern of unstable, intense relationships, such as believing someone is perfect one moment and then suddenly believing the person doesn't care enough or is cruel. | Quick changes in how you see yourself. This includes shifting goals and values, as well as seeing yourself as bad or as if you don't exist. | Periods of stress-related paranoia and loss of contact with reality. These periods can last from a few minutes to a few hours. | Impulsive and risky behavior, such as gambling, dangerous driving, unsafe sex, spending sprees, binge eating, drug misuse, or sabotaging success by suddenly quitting a good job or ending a positive relationship. | Threats of suicide or self-injury, often in response to fears of separation or rejection. | Wide mood swings that last from a few hours to a few days. These mood swings can include periods of being very happy, irritable or anxious, or feeling shame. | Ongoing feelings of emptiness. | Inappropriate, strong anger, such as losing your temper often, being sarcastic or bitter, or physically fighting.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/borderline-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20370237
Narcissistic personality disorder,"Narcissistic personality disorder is a mental health condition in which people have an unreasonably high sense of their own importance. They need and seek too much attention and want people to admire them. People with this disorder may lack the ability to understand or care about the feelings of others. But behind this mask of extreme confidence, they are not sure of their self-worth and are easily upset by the slightest criticism.
A narcissistic personality disorder causes problems in many areas of life, such as relationships, work, school or financial matters. People with narcissistic personality disorder may be generally unhappy and disappointed when they're not given the special favors or admiration that they believe they deserve. They may find their relationships troubled and unfulfilling, and other people may not enjoy being around them.
Treatment for narcissistic personality disorder centers around talk therapy, also called psychotherapy.
Narcissistic personality disorder affects more males than females, and it often begins in the teens or early adulthood. Some children may show traits of narcissism, but this is often typical for their age and doesn't mean they'll go on to develop narcissistic personality disorder.","Symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder and how severe they are can vary. People with the disorder can: | Have an unreasonably high sense of self-importance and require constant, excessive admiration. | Feel that they deserve privileges and special treatment. | Expect to be recognized as superior even without achievements. | Make achievements and talents seem bigger than they are. | Be preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, brilliance, beauty or the perfect mate. | Believe they are superior to others and can only spend time with or be understood by equally special people. | Be critical of and look down on people they feel are not important. | Expect special favors and expect other people to do what they want without questioning them. | Take advantage of others to get what they want. | Have an inability or unwillingness to recognize the needs and feelings of others. | Be envious of others and believe others envy them. | Behave in an arrogant way, brag a lot and come across as conceited. | Insist on having the best of everything — for instance, the best car or office. | At the same time, people with narcissistic personality disorder have trouble handling anything they view as criticism. They can: | Become impatient or angry when they don't receive special recognition or treatment. | Have major problems interacting with others and easily feel slighted. | React with rage or contempt and try to belittle other people to make themselves appear superior. | Have difficulty managing their emotions and behavior. | Experience major problems dealing with stress and adapting to change. | Withdraw from or avoid situations in which they might fail. | Feel depressed and moody because they fall short of perfection. | Have secret feelings of insecurity, shame, humiliation and fear of being exposed as a failure.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20366662
Schizoid personality disorder,"Schizoid personality disorder is a condition where a person shows very little, if any, interest and ability to form relationships with other people. It's very hard for the person to express a full range of emotions.
If you have schizoid personality disorder, you may be seen as keeping to yourself or rejecting others. You may not be interested in or able to form close friendships or romantic relationships. Because you do not tend to show emotion, it may appear that you do not care about others or what's going on around you.
Schizoid personality disorder is less common than other personality disorders, but it's much more common than schizophrenia. The cause is not known. Some symptoms of schizoid personality disorder are similar to autism spectrum disorders, other personality disorders — especially avoidant personality disorder — and early symptoms of schizophrenia.
Talk therapy, also called psychotherapy, can help those who know they need to improve relationships with others. But it's common to feel unsure about change. Medicines are mainly used to treat mental health conditions that occur along with schizoid personality disorder, rather than the disorder itself.","If you have schizoid personality disorder, it's likely that you: | Want to be alone and do activities alone. | Do not want or enjoy close relationships. | Feel little if any desire for sexual relationships. | Take pleasure in few activities, if any. | Find it hard to express your emotions and react. | May lack humor or not be interested in others. Or you may be cold toward others. | May lack the drive that makes you want to reach goals. | Do not react to praise or criticism from others. | People may view you as odd or unusual. | Schizoid personality disorder most often begins when a person is a young adult.

Schizotypal personality disorder,"People with schizotypal personality disorder are often described as odd or eccentric, and they usually have few, if any, close relationships. They generally don't know how relationships form or how their behavior affects others. They also tend to misinterpret others' motivations and behaviors and greatly distrust others.
These problems may lead to severe anxiety and a tendency to stay away from social situations. That's because people with schizotypal personality disorder tend to hold odd beliefs and may find it hard to respond correctly to social cues.
Schizotypal personality disorder usually is diagnosed in early adulthood, although some features of this condition may show up during childhood and the teen years. It's likely to be a lifelong condition. Treatments, such as medicines and therapy, can make symptoms better.","Schizotypal personality disorder usually includes five or more of these symptoms. The person may: | Be a loner and lack close friends and other relationships outside of the immediate family. | Have flat emotions or have emotional responses that are limited or not proper socially. | Have too much social anxiety, which is ongoing. | Incorrectly interpret events, such as feeling that something harmless or not offensive has a direct personal meaning. | Have strange or unusual thinking, beliefs or mannerisms. | Have suspicious or paranoid thoughts and constant doubts about the loyalty of others. | Believe in special powers, such as mental telepathy or superstitions. | Have unusual thoughts, such as sensing an absent person's presence, or having illusions. | Dress in odd ways, such as appearing messy or wearing oddly matched clothes. | Speak in an odd way, such as vague or unusual patterns of speaking, or ramble oddly while speaking. | Symptoms of schizotypal personality disorder, such as more interest in activities done alone or a high level of social anxiety, may be seen in the teen years.

Personality disorders,"People have unique personalities made up of a complex combination of different traits. Personality traits affect how people understand and relate to the world around them, as well as how they see themselves.
Ideally, people's personality traits allow them to flexibly adapt to their changing environment in ways that lead to more healthy relationships with others and better coping strategies. When people have personality traits that are less adaptive, this leads to inflexibility and unhealthy coping. For example, they may manage stress by drinking or misusing drugs, have a hard time managing their anger, and find it hard to trust and connect with others.

Flatfeet can occur when the arches don't develop during childhood. It can also develop later in life after an injury or from the simple wear-and-tear stresses of age.
Flatfeet is usually painless. If you aren't having pain, no treatment is necessary. However, if flatfeet is causing you pain and limiting what you want to do, then an evaluation from a specialist may be warranted.","Most people have no symptoms associated with flatfeet.

Absence seizure,"Absence seizures involve brief, sudden lapses of consciousness. They're more common in children than in adults.
A person having an absence seizure may stare blankly into space for a few seconds. Then the person typically returns quickly to being alert. This type of seizure usually doesn't lead to physical injury. But injury can happen if someone is driving a car or riding a bike when the seizure happens.
Absence seizures usually can be managed with antiseizure medicines. Some children who have them also develop other seizures, such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures or myoclonic seizures. Many children outgrow absence seizures in their teens.","A simple absence seizure causes a vacant stare, which may be mistaken for a brief lapse in attention. The seizure lasts about 10 seconds, though it may last as long as 30 seconds.

Peyronie disease,"Peyronie (pay-roe-NEE) disease is a condition in which fibrous scar tissue forms in the deeper tissues under the skin of the penis. This causes curved, painful erections. It also can make the penis shorter while erect. Peyronie disease is not caused by cancer.
Penises vary in shape and size. So having a curved erection isn't always a cause for concern. But Peyronie disease causes a serious bend or pain in some people.
This can prevent you from having sex. Or it might make it hard to get or keep an erection, which also is called erectile dysfunction. For many people, Peyronie disease also causes stress and anxiety.
Peyronie disease rarely goes away on its own. In most people with the condition, it will remain as is or may get slightly worse early on. Early treatment soon after you get the condition may keep it from getting worse or even improve symptoms. Even if you've had Peyronie disease for some time, treatment may help ease symptoms such as pain, curving and shortening.","Peyronie disease symptoms might start suddenly or appear over time. The most common symptoms include: | Scar tissue.The scar tissue linked with Peyronie disease also is called plaque. It's different from plaque that can build up in blood vessels or on your teeth. It can be felt under the skin of the penis as flat lumps or a band of hard tissue. The area over the scar tissue may feel tender. | A bend to the penis.The penis might curve upward or downward or bend to one side. | Erection problems.Peyronie disease might cause problems getting or keeping an erection.

Phenylketonuria (PKU),"Phenylketonuria (fen-ul-key-toe-NU-ree-uh), also called PKU, is a rare inherited disorder that causes an amino acid called phenylalanine to build up in the body.PKUis caused by a change in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. This gene helps create the enzyme needed to break down phenylalanine.
Without the enzyme necessary to break down phenylalanine, a dangerous buildup can develop when a person withPKUeats foods that contain protein or eats aspartame, an artificial sweetener. This can eventually lead to serious health problems.
For the rest of their lives, people withPKU— babies, children and adults — need to follow a diet that limits phenylalanine, which is found mostly in foods that contain protein. Newer medications may allow some people withPKUto eat a diet that has a higher or an unrestricted amount of phenylalanine.
Babies in the United States and many other countries are screened forPKUsoon after birth. Although there is no cure forPKU, recognizingPKUand starting treatment right away can help prevent limitations in areas of thinking, understanding and communicating (intellectual disability) and major health problems.","Newborns withPKUinitially don't have any symptoms. However, without treatment, babies usually develop signs ofPKUwithin a few months. | Signs and symptoms of untreatedPKUcan be mild or severe and may include: | A musty odor in the breath, skin or urine, caused by too much phenylalanine in the body | Nervous system (neurological) problems that may include seizures | Skin rashes, such as eczema | Lighter skin, hair and eye color than family members, because phenylalanine can't transform into melanin — the pigment responsible for hair and skin tone | Unusually small head size (microcephaly) | Hyperactivity | Intellectual disability | Delayed development | Behavioral, emotional and social problems | Mental health disorders",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/phenylketonuria/symptoms-causes/syc-20376302

You have two adrenal glands — one at the top of each kidney. The adrenal glands make hormones that help control key processes in the body, such as blood pressure. Usually, a pheochromocytoma forms in only one adrenal gland. But tumors can grow in both adrenal glands.
With a pheochromocytoma, the tumor releases hormones that can cause various symptoms. They include high blood pressure, headache, sweating and symptoms of a panic attack. If a pheochromocytoma isn't treated, serious or life-threatening damage to other body systems can happen.
Surgery to remove a pheochromocytoma often returns blood pressure to a healthy range.","A pheochromocytoma often causes the following symptoms: | High blood pressure. | Headache. | Heavy sweating. | Rapid heartbeat. | Some people with pheochromocytomas also have symptoms such as: | Nervous shaking. | Skin that turns a lighter color, also called pallor. | Shortness of breath. | Panic attack-type symptoms, which can include sudden intense fear. | Anxiety or a sense of doom. | Vision problems. | Constipation. | Weight loss. | Some people with pheochromocytomas have no symptoms.

But in social anxiety disorder, also called social phobia, everyday interactions cause significant anxiety, self-consciousness and embarrassment because you fear being scrutinized or judged negatively by others.
In social anxiety disorder, fear and anxiety lead to avoidance that can disrupt your life. Severe stress can affect your relationships, daily routines, work, school or other activities.
Social anxiety disorder can be a chronic mental health condition, but learning coping skills in psychotherapy and taking medications can help you gain confidence and improve your ability to interact with others.","Feelings of shyness or discomfort in certain situations aren't necessarily signs of social anxiety disorder, particularly in children.

Social anxiety disorder typically begins in the early to mid-teens, though it can sometimes start in younger children or in adults. | Signs and symptoms of social anxiety disorder can include constant: | Fear of situations in which you may be judged negatively | Worry about embarrassing or humiliating yourself | Intense fear of interacting or talking with strangers | Fear that others will notice that you look anxious | Fear of physical symptoms that may cause you embarrassment, such as blushing, sweating, trembling or having a shaky voice | Avoidance of doing things or speaking to people out of fear of embarrassment | Avoidance of situations where you might be the center of attention | Anxiety in anticipation of a feared activity or event | Intense fear or anxiety during social situations | Analysis of your performance and identification of flaws in your interactions after a social situation | Expectation of the worst possible consequences from a negative experience during a social situation | For children, anxiety about interacting with adults or peers may be shown by crying, having temper tantrums, clinging to parents or refusing to speak in social situations. | Performance type of social anxiety disorder is when you experience intense fear and anxiety during speaking or performing in public but not in other types of more general social situations. | Physical signs and symptoms can sometimes accompany social anxiety disorder and may include: | Blushing | Fast heartbeat | Trembling | Sweating | Upset stomach or nausea | Trouble catching your breath | Dizziness or lightheadedness | Feeling that your mind has gone blank | Muscle tension | Common, everyday experiences may be hard to endure when you have social anxiety disorder, including: | Interacting with unfamiliar people or strangers | Attending parties or social gatherings | Going to work or school | Starting conversations | Making eye contact | Dating | Entering a room in which people are already seated | Returning items to a store | Eating in front of others | Using a public restroom | Social anxiety disorder symptoms can change over time. They may flare up if you're facing a lot of changes, stress or demands in your life. Although avoiding situations that produce anxiety may make you feel better in the short term, your anxiety is likely to continue over the long term if you don't get treatment. | See your doctor or a mental health professional if you fear and avoid normal social situations because they cause embarrassment, worry or panic.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/social-anxiety-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20353561
Frontotemporal dementia,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is an umbrella term for a group of brain diseases that mainly affect the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. These areas of the brain are associated with personality, behavior and language.
In frontotemporal dementia, parts of these lobes shrink, known as atrophy. Symptoms depend on which part of the brain is affected. Some people with frontotemporal dementia have changes in their personalities. They become socially inappropriate and may be impulsive or emotionally indifferent. Others lose the ability to properly use language.
Frontotemporal dementia can be misdiagnosed as a mental health condition or as Alzheimer's disease. ButFTDtends to occur at a younger age than does Alzheimer's disease. It often begins between the ages of 40 and 65, although it can occur later in life as well.FTDis the cause of dementia about 10% to 20% of the time.","Symptoms of frontotemporal dementia differ from one person to the next. Symptoms get worse over time, usually over years. | People with frontotemporal dementia tend to have clusters of symptom types that occur together. They also may have more than one cluster of symptom types.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/frontotemporal-dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354737
Hemorrhoids,"Hemorrhoids (HEM-uh-roids), also called piles, are swollen veins in the anus and lower rectum. Hemorrhoids are similar to varicose veins. Hemorrhoids can develop inside the rectum, called internal hemorrhoids. They also can develop under the skin around the anus, called external hemorrhoids.
There are several options available to treat hemorrhoids. Many people get relief with home treatments and lifestyle changes.",Symptoms of hemorrhoids usually depend on the type of hemorrhoid.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemorrhoids/symptoms-causes/syc-20360268
Sacral dimple,"A sacral dimple is an indentation or pit in the skin on the lower back that is present at birth in some babies. It's usually just above the crease between the buttocks. Most sacral dimples are harmless and don't need treatment.
A sacral dimple can be a sign of a serious spinal problem in a newborn if the dimple is large or appears near a tuft of hair, skin tag, lump or discolored area. In these instances, your child's health care provider may recommend an imaging test. If a spinal problem is found, treatment depends on the underlying cause.",A sacral dimple is an indentation or pit in the skin on the lower back.

Acne,"Acne is a skin condition that occurs when your hair follicles become plugged with oil and dead skin cells. It causes whiteheads, blackheads or pimples. Acne is most common among teenagers, though it affects people of all ages.
Effective acne treatments are available, but acne can be persistent. The pimples and bumps heal slowly, and when one begins to go away, others seem to crop up.
Depending on its severity, acne can cause emotional distress and scar the skin. The earlier you start treatment, the lower your risk of such problems.","Acne signs vary depending on the severity of your condition: | Whiteheads (closed plugged pores) | Blackheads (open plugged pores) | Small red, tender bumps (papules) | Pimples (pustules), which are papules with pus at their tips | Large, solid, painful lumps under the skin (nodules) | Painful, pus-filled lumps under the skin (cystic lesions) | Acne usually appears on the face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acne/symptoms-causes/syc-20368047
Pinched nerve,"A pinched nerve occurs when too much pressure is applied to a nerve by surrounding tissues, such as bones, cartilage, muscles or tendons. This pressure can cause pain, tingling, numbness or weakness.
A pinched nerve can occur in many areas of the body. For example, a herniated disk in the lower spine may put pressure on a nerve root. This may cause pain that radiates down the back of the leg. A pinched nerve in the wrist can lead to pain and numbness in the hand and fingers, known as carpal tunnel syndrome.
With rest and other conservative treatments, most people recover from a pinched nerve within a few days or weeks. Sometimes, surgery is needed to relieve pain from a pinched nerve.","Pinched nerve symptoms include: | Numbness or less feeling in the area supplied by the nerve. | Sharp, aching or burning pain, which may radiate outward. | Tingling, or a pins and needles feeling. | Muscle weakness in the affected area. | Often feeling as if a foot or hand has ""fallen asleep."" | Symptoms related to a pinched nerve may be worse when you're sleeping.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pinched-nerve/symptoms-causes/syc-20354746
Pineoblastoma,"Pineoblastoma is a type of cancer that starts in the brain's pineal gland. The pineal gland is located in the center of the brain. The gland makes a hormone called melatonin. Melatonin plays a role in the body's natural sleep-wake cycle.
Pineoblastoma begins as a growth of cells in the pineal gland. The cells grow quickly and can invade and destroy healthy body tissue.
Pineoblastoma can occur at any age. But it happens most often in young children. Pineoblastoma may cause headaches, sleepiness and changes in the way the eyes move.
Pineoblastoma can be very difficult to treat. It can spread within the brain and into the fluid around the brain. This fluid is called cerebrospinal fluid. Pineoblastoma almost never spreads beyond the central nervous system. Treatment usually involves surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible. Additional treatments also may be recommended.",Pineoblastoma signs and symptoms include: | Behavior changes. | Headaches. | Lack of energy. | Nausea. | Problems with memory and thinking. | Pineoblastoma sometimes causes eye symptoms. This can happen when the cancer causes pressure on parts of the brain that help with vision. The eye symptoms that pineoblastoma causes are sometimes called Parinaud syndrome. Eye symptoms caused by pineoblastoma include: | Blurred vision. | Double vision. | Problems focusing on objects that are up close. | Problems looking upward.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pineoblastoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20577723
Pink eye (conjunctivitis),"Pink eye is an inflammation of the transparent membrane that lines the eyelid and eyeball. This membrane is called the conjunctiva. When small blood vessels in the conjunctiva become swollen and irritated, they're more visible. This is what causes the whites of the eyes to appear reddish or pink. Pink eye also is called conjunctivitis.
Pink eye is most often caused by a viral infection. It also can be caused by a bacterial infection, an allergic reaction or — in babies — an incompletely opened tear duct.
Though pink eye can be irritating, it rarely affects your vision. Treatments can help ease the discomfort of pink eye. Because pink eye can be contagious, getting an early diagnosis and taking certain precautions can help limit its spread.","The most common pink eye symptoms include: | Redness in one or both eyes. | Itchiness in one or both eyes. | A gritty feeling in one or both eyes. | A discharge in one or both eyes that forms a crust during the night that may prevent your eye or eyes from opening in the morning. | Tearing. | Sensitivity to light, called photophobia.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pink-eye/symptoms-causes/syc-20376355

Pituitary tumors,"Pituitary tumors are unusual growths that develop in the pituitary gland. This gland is an organ about the size of a pea. It's located behind the nose at the base of the brain. Some of these tumors cause the pituitary gland to make too much of certain hormones that control important body functions. Others can cause the pituitary gland to make too little of those hormones.
Most pituitary tumors are benign. That means they are not cancer. Another name for these noncancerous tumors is pituitary adenomas. Most adenomas stay in the pituitary gland or in the tissue around it, and they grow slowly. They typically don't spread to other parts of the body.
Pituitary tumors can be treated in several ways. The tumor may be removed with surgery. Or its growth may be controlled with medications or radiation therapy. Sometimes, hormone levels are managed with medicine. Your health care provider may suggest a combination of these treatments. In some cases, observation — also called a ''wait-and-see'' approach — may be the right choice.","Not all pituitary tumors cause symptoms. Sometimes these tumors are found during an imaging test, such as anMRIor aCTscan, that is done for another reason. If they don't cause symptoms, pituitary tumors usually don't need treatment. | Pituitary tumor symptoms may be caused by a tumor putting pressure on the brain or on other parts of the body nearby. Symptoms also can be caused by a hormone imbalance. Hormone levels can rise when a pituitary tumor makes too much of one or more hormones. Or a large tumor that disrupts the way the pituitary gland works may cause hormone levels to fall.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pituitary-tumors/symptoms-causes/syc-20350548
Hypopituitarism,"Hypopituitarism is a rare condition in which the pituitary gland doesn't make one or more hormones or doesn't make enough hormones.
The pituitary gland is a kidney-bean-sized gland at the base of your brain. It is part of the body's system of glands that make hormones, called the endocrine system. The pituitary gland makes several hormones. They act on nearly every part of the body.
Hypopituitarism is when there isn't enough of one or more of the pituitary hormones. This lack of hormones, called a deficiency, can affect how the body works in many ways. These include growth, blood pressure and the ability to have children, among others. Symptoms depend on which hormones are missing.
People who have hypopituitarism usually need to take medicines for the rest of their lives. These medicines replace the missing hormones, which helps control symptoms.","The symptoms of hypopituitarism usually start slowly and get worse over time. They might not be noticed for months or even years. But for some people, symptoms start suddenly. | Symptoms of hypopituitarism vary from person to person. Symptoms depend on what hormones are missing and how little of the hormone is being made. There might be more than one hormone that's low. A second hormone deficiency might increase the symptoms of the first one. Or sometimes, it might hide those symptoms.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypopituitarism/symptoms-causes/syc-20351645

Polycystic kidney disease,"Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a condition in which clusters of cysts grow in the body, mainly in the kidneys. Over time, the cysts may cause the kidneys to get bigger and stop working. PKD is most often passed through families. This is called an inherited condition.
Cysts are round sacs with fluid in them. They are not cancer. In PKD, the cysts vary in size. They can grow very large. Having many cysts or large cysts can damage the kidneys.
Polycystic kidney disease also can cause cysts to grow in the liver, the pancreas and other places in the body. The disease can cause serious complications, including high blood pressure and kidney failure.
PKD varies greatly in how bad it is. It's possible to prevent some complications. Lifestyle changes and treatments might help reduce damage to the kidneys.","Polycystic kidney disease symptoms can include: | High blood pressure. | Belly, side or back pain. | Blood in the urine. | A feeling of fullness in the belly. | Increased size of the belly from enlarged kidneys. | Headaches. | Kidney stones. | Kidney failure. | Urinary tract or kidney infections.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/polycystic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352820

Plague,"Plague is a serious illness caused by a germ called Yersinia pestis. The germs mostly live in small rodents and their fleas. The most common way for humans to get plague is a flea bite.
Plague is a rare disease. The illness mostly occurs in only a few countries around the world. In the United States, plague affects a few people each year in rural or semirural areas of western states.
Plague usually can be treated with antibiotics. If not treated, the illness is often deadly.
Plague is considered a potential bioweapon. The U.S. government has plans and treatments in place if the disease is used as a weapon.",There are three types of plague. The symptoms vary for each type.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/plague/symptoms-causes/syc-20351291
Plantar fasciitis,"Plantar fasciitis (PLAN-tur fas-e-I-tis) is one of the most common causes of heel pain. It involves inflammation of a thick band of tissue that runs across the bottom of each foot and connects the heel bone to the toes, known as the plantar fascia.
Plantar fasciitis commonly causes stabbing pain that often occurs with your first steps in the morning. As you get up and move, the pain normally decreases, but it might return after long periods of standing or when you stand up after sitting.
The cause of plantar fasciitis is poorly understood. It is more common in runners and in people who are overweight.","Plantar fasciitis typically causes a stabbing pain in the bottom of your foot near the heel. The pain is usually the worst with the first few steps after awakening, although it also can be triggered by long periods of standing or when you get up from sitting.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/plantar-fasciitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354846
Morton's neuroma,"Morton's neuroma is a painful condition that affects the ball of your foot, most commonly the area between your third and fourth toes. Morton's neuroma may feel as if you are standing on a pebble in your shoe or on a fold in your sock.
Morton's neuroma involves a thickening of the tissue around one of the nerves leading to your toes. This can cause a sharp, burning pain in the ball of your foot. You may have stinging, burning or numbness in the affected toes.
High-heeled or tight shoes have been linked to the development of Morton's neuroma. Many people experience relief by switching to lower heeled shoes with wider toe boxes. Sometimes corticosteroid injections or surgery may be necessary.","Typically, there's no outward sign of this condition, such as a lump. Instead, you may experience the following symptoms: | A feeling as if you're standing on a pebble in your shoe | A burning pain in the ball of your foot that may radiate into your toes | Tingling or numbness in your toes | In addition to these symptoms, you may find that removing your shoe and rubbing your foot often helps to relieve the pain.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mortons-neuroma/symptoms-causes/syc-20351935
Plantar warts,"Plantar warts are small, rough growths on the feet. They usually show up on the balls and heels of the feet, the areas that bear the most pressure. This pressure may also cause a wart to grow inward beneath a hard, thick layer of skin (callus).
Plantar warts are caused by HPV. This virus enters through tiny cuts or breaks on the bottom of the feet.
Most plantar warts aren't a serious health concern and often go away without treatment, especially in children under 12. To get rid of them sooner, you can try self-care treatments or see your health care provider.","Plantar wart signs and symptoms include: | A small, rough growth on the bottom of your foot, usually at the base of the toes or on the ball or heel | On brown and Black skin, the growth may be lighter than unaffected skin | Hard, thickened skin (callus) over a spot on the skin, where a wart has grown inward | Black pinpoints, which are small clotted blood vessels commonly called wart seeds | A cluster of growths on the sole of the foot (mosaic warts) | A growth that interrupts the normal lines and ridges in the skin of your foot | Pain or tenderness when walking or standing",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/plantar-warts/symptoms-causes/syc-20352691
Pleurisy,"Pleurisy (PLOOR-ih-see) is a condition in which the pleura — two large, thin layers of tissue that separate your lungs from your chest wall — becomes inflamed. Also called pleuritis, pleurisy causes sharp chest pain (pleuritic pain) that worsens during breathing.
One pleural layer of tissue wraps around the outside of the lungs. The other pleural layer lines the inner chest wall. Between these two layers is a small space (pleural space) that's usually filled with a very small amount of liquid. These layers act like two pieces of smooth satin gliding past each other, allowing your lungs to expand and contract when you breathe.
If you have pleurisy, these tissues swell and become inflamed. As a result, the two layers of the pleural lining rub against each other like two pieces of sandpaper. This causes pain when you breathe in and out. The pleuritic pain lessens or stops when you hold your breath.
Treatment of pleurisy involves pain control and treating the cause.","Signs and symptoms of pleurisy might include: | Chest pain that worsens when you breathe, cough or sneeze. | Shortness of breath — often from trying to limit breathing in and out. | Cough — only in some cases. | Fever — only in some cases. | Pain caused by pleurisy might worsen with movement of your upper body and can spread to your shoulders or back. | Pleurisy can occur along with pleural effusion, atelectasis or empyema: | Pleural effusion.In some cases of pleurisy, fluid builds up in the small space between the two layers of tissue. This is called pleural effusion. When there is a fair amount of fluid, pleuritic pain lessens or disappears because the two layers of pleura are no longer in contact and don't rub together. | Atelectasis.A large amount of fluid in the pleural space can create pressure. This can compress your lung to the point that it partially or completely collapses (atelectasis). This makes breathing difficult and might cause coughing. | Empyema.The extra fluid in the pleural space can also become infected, resulting in a buildup of pus. This is called an empyema. Fever often occurs along with an empyema.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pleurisy/symptoms-causes/syc-20351863
Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS),"Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is a type of motor neuron disease. A motor neuron disease affects the nerve cells in the brain that control movement. InPLS, the breakdown of nerve cells causes weakness in the muscles that control the legs, arms and tongue.
Symptoms typically begin with balance trouble. People withPLSmay move slowly and are clumsy. Over time, symptoms evolve to include having trouble with their hands and arms, followed by problems with chewing, swallowing and speaking. Less commonly, the condition may begin with problems with speaking and swallowing.
This rare condition can develop at any age, but it usually occurs between ages 40 and 60.PLSis more common in men than in women. Rarely,PLScan begin in early childhood. This subtype is known as juvenile primary lateral sclerosis. JuvenilePLSis caused by a change in a gene that's passed from both parents to a child.
PLSis often mistaken for another, more common motor neuron disease called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). While likely related toALS,PLSgets worse more slowly thanALS. In most people,PLSisn't fatal.","Symptoms of primary lateral sclerosis usually take years to develop and get worse. Symptoms generally begin in the legs. Rarely,PLSbegins with weakness in the tongue or hands. Then weakness gradually moves down the spinal cord to the legs. However, symptoms vary from person to person. Symptoms may include: | Stiffness, weakness and muscle spasms in the legs. This is known as spasticity. Rarely, spasticity starts in only one leg and moves to the arms, hands, tongue and jaw. | Slowed movement. | Tripping, being clumsy and having trouble with balance. | Hand clumsiness. | A hoarse voice, as well as slowed, slurred speech and drooling. | Trouble chewing and swallowing. | Sometimes, frequent, rapid and intense shifts in emotions. | Rarely, breathing problems and bladder problems late in the disease.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/primary-lateral-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353968
Pneumonia,"Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.
Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. It is most serious for infants and young children, people older than age 65, and people with health problems or weakened immune systems.","The signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe, depending on factors such as the type of germ causing the infection, and your age and overall health. Mild signs and symptoms often are similar to those of a cold or flu, but they last longer. | Signs and symptoms of pneumonia may include: | Chest pain when you breathe or cough | Confusion or changes in mental awareness (in adults age 65 and older) | Cough, which may produce phlegm | Fatigue | Fever, sweating and shaking chills | Lower than normal body temperature (in adults older than age 65 and people with weak immune systems) | Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea | Shortness of breath | Newborns and infants may not show any sign of the infection. Or they may vomit, have a fever and cough, appear restless or tired and without energy, or have difficulty breathing and eating. | See your doctor if you have difficulty breathing, chest pain, persistent fever of 102 F (39 C) or higher, or persistent cough, especially if you're coughing up pus. | It's especially important that people in these high-risk groups see a doctor: | Adults older than age 65 | Children younger than age 2 with signs and symptoms | People with an underlying health condition or weakened immune system | People receiving chemotherapy or taking medication that suppresses the immune system | For some older adults and people with heart failure or chronic lung problems, pneumonia can quickly become a life-threatening condition.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumonia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354204
Pneumonitis,"Pneumonitis (noo-moe-NIE-tis) is a general term that refers to swelling and irritation, also called inflammation, of lung tissue. Lung infections such as pneumonia also can cause lung tissue to become inflamed. But pneumonitis generally refers to inflamed lung tissue not caused by an infection.
Pneumonitis is a result of an extra strong defense response by the body's immune system to an irritating substance. Common causes of pneumonitis include airborne irritants at a job, in the home or from hobbies. Other causes include some cancer treatments and many different medicines.
Trouble breathing, and often a dry cough, are the most common symptoms of pneumonitis. Treatment focuses on avoiding irritants and lessening the inflammation of lung tissue.","Symptoms of pneumonitis may develop quickly or slowly and can worsen over time. At times symptoms may suddenly get worse or better. Also, symptoms vary greatly among people with the condition and include: | Trouble breathing. | Dry cough that usually doesn't bring up any mucus. | Extreme tiredness. | Loss of appetite. | Fever. | Joint and muscle pain. | Headache. | Weight loss.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumonitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352623
Pneumothorax,"A pneumothorax (noo-moe-THOR-aks) is a collapsed lung. A pneumothorax occurs when air leaks into the space between your lung and chest wall. This air pushes on the outside of your lung and makes it collapse. A pneumothorax can be a complete lung collapse or a collapse of only a portion of the lung.
A pneumothorax can be caused by a blunt or penetrating chest injury, certain medical procedures, or damage from underlying lung disease. Or it may occur for no obvious reason. Symptoms usually include sudden chest pain and shortness of breath. On some occasions, a collapsed lung can be a life-threatening event.
Treatment for a pneumothorax usually involves inserting a needle or chest tube between the ribs to remove the excess air. However, a small pneumothorax may heal on its own.",The main symptoms of a pneumothorax are sudden chest pain and shortness of breath. Severity of symptoms may depend on how much of the lung is collapsed.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumothorax/symptoms-causes/syc-20350367
POEMS syndrome,"POEMS syndrome is a rare blood disorder that damages your nerves and affects other parts of your body. POEMS stands for these signs and symptoms:
The cause of POEMS syndrome isn't known. But people with POEMS syndrome have an increased number of plasma cells. These cells produce an abnormal amount of a type of protein, which can damage other parts of the body.
POEMS syndrome can be misdiagnosed because the signs and symptoms mimic those of other disorders. POEMS syndrome progresses rapidly without treatment and can become life-threatening, so early diagnosis is important.
Treatment for POEMS syndrome might improve your symptoms but doesn't cure the condition. Treatment options include radiation therapy, chemotherapy and stem cell transplant. The outlook for people with POEMS syndrome has improved greatly over the past decade or so.",,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/poems-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20352678
Poison ivy rash,"Poison ivy rash is caused by an allergic reaction to an oily resin called urushiol (u-ROO-she-ol). This oil is in the leaves, stems and roots of poison ivy, poison oak and poison sumac.
Wash your skin right away if you come into contact with this oil, unless you know you're not sensitive to it. Washing off the oil may reduce your chances of getting a poison ivy rash. If you develop a rash, it can be very itchy and last for weeks.
You can treat mild cases of poison ivy rash at home with soothing lotions and cool baths. You may need prescription medication for a rash that's severe or widespread — especially if it's on your face or genitals.","Signs and symptoms of a poison ivy rash include: | Redness | Itching | Swelling | Blisters | Difficulty breathing, if you've inhaled the smoke from burning poison ivy | Poison ivy rash often appears in a straight line because of the way the plant brushes against your skin. But if you develop a rash after touching a piece of clothing or pet fur that has urushiol on it, the rash may be more spread out. You can also transfer the oil to other parts of your body with your fingers. The reaction usually develops 12 to 48 hours after exposure and lasts two to three weeks. | The severity of the rash depends on the amount of urushiol that gets on your skin.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/poison-ivy/symptoms-causes/syc-20376485
Polio,"Polio is an illness caused by a virus that mainly affects nerves in the spinal cord or brain stem. In its most severe form, polio can lead to a person being unable to move certain limbs, also called paralysis. It can also lead to trouble breathing and sometimes death. The disease also is called poliomyelitis.
A vaccination effort throughout the world has led to only a small number of cases to occur around the world in recent years. But poliovirus still spreads within areas with low vaccination rates.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes travel notices of countries where there is a higher risk of polio. Countries at a higher risk of polio are generally in Africa, the Middle East, and southern and central Asia.
Vaccinated adults who plan to travel to an area where polio is spreading should get a booster dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). Immunity after a booster lasts a lifetime.","Most people infected with the virus that causes polio, called poliovirus, don't get symptoms.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/polio/symptoms-causes/syc-20376512

Most of the time, the condition is mild. It's often found during the middle or later stages of pregnancy. Severe polyhydramnios may cause shortness of breath, preterm labor or other symptoms.
If you learn that you have polyhydramnios, your health care team carefully tracks your pregnancy to help prevent health problems. Treatment depends on how serious the condition is. Mild polyhydramnios may go away on its own. Severe polyhydramnios may need to be watched more closely by your care team.","Polyhydramnios symptoms may be linked with the buildup of amniotic fluid creating pressure within the uterus and on nearby organs. Mild polyhydramnios often causes few or no symptoms. But serious forms of the condition may cause: | Shortness of breath or not being able to breathe. | Swelling in the ankles or feet. | Pain in the stomach area. | Feelings of tightness in the muscles of the uterus, called contractions. | Your health care professional also may also suspect polyhydramnios if your uterus has become large for the number of weeks of pregnancy.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/polyhydramnios/symptoms-causes/syc-20368493

Anyone can develop colon polyps, and your risk increases as you age. Your risk for colorectal cancer also is higher if you are overweight, smoke, have a personal history of colon polyps, or a family history of advanced colon polyps or colorectal cancer.
Colon polyps don't usually cause symptoms. It's important to have regular screening tests because colon polyps found early can usually be removed safely and completely. The best prevention for colorectal cancer is regular screening.","Most people with colon polyps do not have any symptoms. Colon polyps are often found as a part of routine colorectal cancer screening. | Symptoms that should prompt an appointment with a healthcare professional include: | Change in bowel habits.Constipation or diarrhea that lasts longer than a week may mean the presence of a larger colon polyp or cancer. However, several other conditions also can cause changes in bowel habits. | Change in stool color.Blood can show up as red streaks in the stool or make stool appear black. A change in color also may be caused by certain foods, medicines or dietary supplements. | Iron deficiency anemia.Bleeding from polyps can happen slowly over time, without visible blood in the stool. Chronic bleeding may lead to iron deficiency anemia, which can cause tiredness and shortness of breath. | Pain.A large colon polyp or cancer can block part of the bowel, leading to cramping and belly pain. | Rectal bleeding.This can be a sign of colon polyps or cancer or other conditions, such as hemorrhoids or minor tears of the anus.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-polyps/symptoms-causes/syc-20352875

Nasal polyps,"Nasal polyps are painless growths inside the nose or the hollow areas inside the bones of the face, also known as sinuses. Nasal polyps aren't cancer.
Small nasal polyps might not cause symptoms. Larger growths or groups of nasal polyps can block the nose. They can lead to breathing problems, not being able to smell and infections.
Nasal polyps can affect anyone. But they're more common in young and middle-aged adults. Medicines can often shrink nasal polyps or get rid of them. But surgery might be needed to remove them. Even after treatment, nasal polyps often come back.","Nasal polyps are linked to irritation and swelling, also called inflammation, of the inside of the nose and sinuses that lasts more than 12 weeks. This is known as chronic sinusitis. But it's possible to have chronic sinusitis without getting nasal polyps. | People who have small nasal polyps might not know they have them. But having more than one polyp or having a large polyp can block the nose. | Common symptoms of chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps include: | Runny, stuffy nose. | Mucus running down the throat, also known as postnasal drip. | Not being able to smell. | Not being able to taste. | Facial pain or headache. | Pain in the teeth. | A sense of pressure over the forehead and face. | Snoring.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nasal-polyps/symptoms-causes/syc-20351888

Dyshidrosis,"Dyshidrosis is a skin condition that causes small, fluid-filled blisters to form on the palms of the hands and sides of the fingers. Sometimes the bottoms of the feet are affected too.
The itchy blisters last a few weeks and often come back.
Treatment for dyshidrosis most often includes prescription steroid skin creams or ointments. Your doctor or other health care provider may suggest a different treatment, such as light therapy or medicine taken by mouth or injection. The right treatment depends on how severe your symptoms are.
Dyshidrosis is also called dyshidrotic eczema and pompholyx.","Dyshidrosis symptoms include painful, itchy and fluid-filled blisters on the sides of the fingers, the palms of the hands and the bottoms of the feet. The blisters are small — about the width of a standard pencil lead. They are grouped in clusters and can look like tapioca. | With severe disease, the small blisters can merge to form larger blisters. Skin affected by dyshidrosis can be painful and very itchy.

Color blindness,"Color blindness is an eye condition in which someone can't see the difference between certain colors. Though many people commonly use the term ""color blind"" for this condition, true color blindness — in which everything is seen in shades of black and white — is rare. The medical term for color blindness is known as color vision deficiency.
Color blindness is usually inherited, meaning it's passed down through families. Men are more likely to be born with color blindness. Most people with color blindness can't tell the difference between certain shades of red and green. Less commonly, people with color blindness can't tell the difference between shades of blue and yellow.
Certain eye diseases and some medicines also can cause color blindness.","You may have a color vision deficiency and not know it. Some people figure out that they or their child has the condition when it causes confusion — such as when there are problems differentiating the colors in a traffic light or interpreting color-coded learning materials. | People affected by color blindness may not be able to distinguish: | Different shades of red and green. | Different shades of blue and yellow. | Any colors. | The most common color deficiency is an inability to see some shades of red and green.

Baker cyst,"A Baker cyst is a fluid-filled growth behind the knee. It causes a bulge and a feeling of tightness. Also called a popliteal (pop-luh-TEE-ul) cyst, a Baker cyst sometime causes pain. The pain can get worse when with activity or when fully straightening or bending the knee.
A Baker cyst is usually the result of a problem with the knee joint, such as arthritis or a cartilage tear. Both conditions can cause the knee to produce too much fluid.
Although a Baker cyst may cause swelling and discomfort, treating the underlying problem that is causing it usually provides relief.","In some cases, a Baker cyst causes no pain, and you may not notice it. If you do have symptoms, they might include: | Swelling behind the knee, and sometimes in the leg | Knee pain | Stiffness and inability to fully flex the knee | The symptoms may be worse after you've been active or if you've been standing for a long time.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bakers-cyst/symptoms-causes/syc-20369950
Porphyria,"Porphyria (por-FEAR-e-uh) refers to a group of rare disorders that result from a buildup of natural chemicals called porphyrins in the body. Porphyrins are needed to make heme, a part of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells. It carries oxygen to the body's organs and tissues.
Eight enzymes are needed to change porphyrins into heme. Without enough of any of these enzymes, porphyrins build up in the body. High levels of porphyrins can cause major problems, mainly in the nervous system and skin.
There are two general types of porphyrias. Acute porphyrias start rapidly and mainly affect the nervous system. Cutaneous porphyrias mainly affect the skin. A few types of porphyrias affect both the nervous system and the skin.
Symptoms of porphyria vary, depending on the specific type of porphyria and how severe it is. Porphyria is usually inherited. One or both parents pass along a changed gene to their child.
Although porphyria can't be cured, medicines and certain lifestyle changes may help you manage it. Treatment for symptoms depends on the type of porphyria you have.",Symptoms can vary widely by type of porphyria and in how severe the symptoms are. Symptoms also can vary among people with the condition. Some people with a gene change that causes porphyria never have any symptoms.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/porphyria/symptoms-causes/syc-20356066
Dressler syndrome,"Dressler syndrome is swelling and irritation of the sac around the heart that happens after damage to the heart muscle. The damage may trigger an immune system response that causes the condition. The damage can result from a heart attack, heart surgery or a serious injury.
Symptoms of Dressler syndrome include chest pain that can feel like chest pain from a heart attack.
Swelling and irritation of the sac around the heart is called pericarditis. Dressler syndrome is a type of pericarditis that can start after the heart muscle is damaged. So you may hear Dressler syndrome called post-traumatic pericarditis.
Some other names for the condition are:","Symptoms of Dressler syndrome are likely to start weeks to a few months after a heart attack, surgery or injury to the chest. Symptoms can include: | Chest pain, which may get worse with deep breaths. | Fever. | Shortness of breath.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dresslers-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20371811
Chemo brain,"Chemo brain is a common term people with cancer use to describe trouble with thinking and memory that can happen during and after cancer treatment. Chemo brain also can be called chemo fog, cancer-related cognitive impairment or cognitive dysfunction.
Chemo brain is a widely used term because this condition was first reported in people having chemotherapy treatments. But experts don't fully know the causes of these concentration and memory changes. There's likely more than one cause.
No matter the cause, chemo brain can be a tough side effect of cancer and its treatment. Researchers are working to understand the memory changes that people with cancer have.","Chemo brain signs and symptoms include changes in memory and thinking. | Symptoms of chemo brain linked to memory may include: | Trouble recalling what you've said to others. | Trouble recalling what you've seen, such as images or lists of words. | Trouble recalling what's happened recently, called short-term memory issues. | Symptoms of chemo brain linked to thinking may include: | Trouble finding the right words. | Trouble learning new skills. | Trouble doing more than one thing at a time. | Mental fog. | Short attention span. | Taking longer than usual to do routine tasks.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chemo-brain/symptoms-causes/syc-20351060
Posterior cortical atrophy,"Posterior cortical atrophy is a brain and nervous system syndrome that causes brain cells to die over time. It causes problems with eyesight and with processing visual information.
Common symptoms include trouble reading, judging distances and reaching for objects. People with the syndrome may not be able to recognize objects and familiar faces. They also may have trouble making calculations. Over time this condition may cause a decline in memory and thinking abilities, known as cognitive skills.
Posterior cortical atrophy causes the loss of brain cells in back of the brain. This is the region responsible for visual processing and spatial reasoning. This changes a person's ability to process visual and spatial information.
In more than 80% of cases, posterior cortical atrophy is due to Alzheimer's disease. However, it can be due to other neurological conditions such as Lewy body dementia or corticobasal degeneration.","Posterior cortical atrophy symptoms vary among people. Symptoms also can vary over time. They tend to gradually get worse. Common symptoms include having trouble with: | Reading, spelling or math. | Driving. | Getting dressed. | Telling the difference between objects that are moving and those that are still. | Judging how far away objects are. | Using everyday objects or tools. | Identifying left from right. | Other common symptoms include: | Anxiety. | Confusion. | Changes in behavior and personality. | Memory problems may occur later in the disease.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/posterior-cortical-atrophy/symptoms-causes/syc-20376560
Posterior vaginal prolapse (rectocele),"A posterior vaginal prolapse is a bulge of tissue into the vagina. It happens when the tissue between the rectum and the vagina weakens or tears. This causes the rectum to push into the vaginal wall. Posterior vaginal prolapse is also called a rectocele (REK-toe-seel).
Childbirth-related tears, chronic straining to pass stool (constipation) and other activities that put pressure on pelvic tissues can lead to posterior vaginal prolapse. A small prolapse might not cause symptoms.
With a large prolapse, you might notice a bulge of tissue that pushes through the opening of the vagina. To pass stool, you might need to support the vaginal wall with your fingers. This is called splinting. The bulge can be uncomfortable, but it's rarely painful.
If needed, self-care measures and other nonsurgical options are often effective. For severe posterior vaginal prolapse, you might need surgery to fix it.","A small posterior vaginal prolapse (rectocele) might cause no symptoms. | Otherwise, you may notice: | A soft bulge of tissue in the vagina that might come through the opening of the vagina | Trouble having a bowel movement | Feeling pressure or fullness in the rectum | A feeling that the rectum has not completely emptied after a bowel movement | Sexual concerns, such as feeling embarrassed or sensing looseness in the tone of the vaginal tissue | Many women with posterior vaginal prolapse also have prolapse of other pelvic organs, such as the bladder or uterus.

Postpartum depression,"The birth of a baby can start a variety of powerful emotions, from excitement and joy to fear and anxiety. But it can also result in something you might not expect — depression.
Most new moms experience postpartum ""baby blues"" after childbirth, which commonly include mood swings, crying spells, anxiety and difficulty sleeping. Baby blues usually begin within the first 2 to 3 days after delivery and may last for up to two weeks.
But some new moms experience a more severe, long-lasting form of depression known as postpartum depression. Sometimes it's called peripartum depression because it can start during pregnancy and continue after childbirth. Rarely, an extreme mood disorder called postpartum psychosis also may develop after childbirth.
Postpartum depression is not a character flaw or a weakness. Sometimes it's simply a complication of giving birth. If you have postpartum depression, prompt treatment can help you manage your symptoms and help you bond with your baby.","Symptoms of depression after childbirth vary, and they can range from mild to severe.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/postpartum-depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20376617

Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety and uncontrollable thoughts about the event.
Most people who go through traumatic events may have a hard time adjusting and coping for a short time. But with time and by taking good care of themselves, they usually get better. If the symptoms get worse, last for months or years, and affect their ability to function daily, they may havePTSD.
Getting treatment afterPTSDsymptoms arise can be very important to ease symptoms and help people function better.","Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may start within the first three months after a traumatic event.

Post-vasectomy pain syndrome,"Vasectomy is a minor procedure that blocks the supply of sperm to the semen. It is a common form of male birth control that is done by cutting and sealing the tubes that carry sperm. The sperm, which can no longer reach the semen, are absorbed by the body.
Vasectomy has a low risk of problems, but some men develop post-vasectomy pain syndrome (PVPS).PVPSinvolves chronic pain in one or both testicles that is still present three months after the procedure. Pain can range from a rare, dull ache to sharp, constant pain that can interfere with daily life. For some men, the pain is severe enough to seek treatment.","Having some discomfort after vasectomy is common, but men withPVPShave pain that never seems to get better after the procedure. | Signs and symptoms ofPVPSmay include: | Pain and tenderness in the scrotum | Pressure or pain after ejaculation | Dull ache in one or both testicles | Pain and tenderness at the site of the vasectomy | Swelling of the small, C-shaped tube behind the testicle where sperm are stored (epididymis) | Pain with sex",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/post-vasectomy-pain-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20527047
Pouchitis,"Pouchitis is swelling and irritation, called inflammation, in the lining of a pouch made during surgery to remove the colon. The pouch is made to treat a bowel disease called ulcerative colitis and some other diseases.
Many people with ulcerative colitis need to have their colons taken out. Surgeons use a procedure calledileoanal anastomosis (J-pouch) surgeryto connect the bowel again after taking out the colon.
InJ-pouchsurgery, surgeons use the end of the small intestine, called the ileum, to make a pouch shaped like the letter J. Surgeons attach the pouch inside the body to the area just above the anus. The pouch holds stool before it leaves the body.
Pouchitis is a complication ofJ-pouchsurgery. It happens in nearly one-half of the people who have the procedure.","Symptoms of pouchitis can include diarrhea, belly pain, joint pain, cramps and fever.

Precocious puberty,"Precocious puberty is when children's bodies begin to change into adult bodies too soon. This change is known as puberty. Most of the time, puberty occurs after age 8 in girls and after age 9 in boys. However, Black, Hispanic, and Native American children might naturally reach puberty earlier. Precocious puberty is when puberty begins too early for the child who's going through it.
In puberty, muscles and bones grow quickly. Bodies change shape and size. And the body becomes able to have children.
The cause of precocious puberty often can't be found. Rarely, certain conditions, such as infections, hormone issues, tumors, brain issues or injuries, may cause precocious puberty. Treatment for precocious puberty usually includes medicines to delay puberty.","Precocious puberty symptoms include: | Breast growth and first period in girls. | Testicle and penis growth, facial hair and deeper voice in boys. | Pubic or underarm hair. | Rapid growth. | Acne. | Adult body odor.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/precocious-puberty/symptoms-causes/syc-20351811

If you have prediabetes, the long-term damage of diabetes — especially to your heart, blood vessels and kidneys — may already be starting. There's good news, however. Progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes isn't inevitable.
Eating healthy foods, making physical activity part of your daily routine and staying at a healthy weight can help bring your blood sugar level back to normal. The same lifestyle changes that can help prevent type 2 diabetes in adults might also help bring children's blood sugar levels back to normal.","Prediabetes doesn't usually have any signs or symptoms. | One possible sign of prediabetes is darkened skin on certain parts of the body.

Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome,"Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a heart condition present at birth. That means it's a congenital heart defect. People withWPWsyndrome have an extra pathway for signals to travel between the heart's upper and lower chambers. This causes a fast heartbeat. Changes in the heartbeat can make it harder for the heart to work as it should.
WPWsyndrome is fairly rare. Another name for it is preexcitation syndrome.
The episodes of fast heartbeats seen in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome usually aren't life-threatening. But serious heart problems can occur. Rarely, the syndrome may lead to sudden cardiac death in children and young adults.
Treatment ofWPWsyndrome may include special actions, medicines, a shock to the heart or a procedure to stop the irregular heartbeats.","The heart rate is the number of times the heart beats each minute. A fast heart rate is called tachycardia (tak-ih-KAHR-dee-uh). | The most common symptom of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a heart rate greater than 100 beats a minute. | InWPWsyndrome, the fast heartbeat can begin suddenly. It may last a few seconds or several hours. Episodes may occur during exercise or while at rest. | Other symptoms ofWPWsyndrome may depend on the speed of the heartbeat and the underlying heart rhythm disorder. | For example, the most common irregular heartbeat seen withWPWsyndrome is supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). During an episode ofSVT, the heart beats about 150 to 220 times a minute, but it can occasionally beat faster or slower. | Some people withWPWsyndrome also have a fast and chaotic heart rhythm disorder called atrial fibrillation. | In general, symptoms ofWPWsyndrome include: | Rapid, fluttering or pounding heartbeats. | Chest pain. | Difficulty breathing. | Dizziness or lightheadedness. | Fainting. | Fatigue. | Shortness of breath. | Anxiety.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20354626

Primary ovarian insufficiency,"Primary ovarian insufficiency occurs when the ovaries stop working as they should before age 40. When this happens, the ovaries don't make the typical amounts of the hormone estrogen or release eggs regularly. The condition often leads to infertility. Another name for primary ovarian insufficiency is premature ovarian insufficiency. It also used to be called premature ovarian failure, but this term isn't used anymore.
Sometimes, primary ovarian insufficiency is confused with premature menopause. But they aren't the same. People with primary ovarian insufficiency can have irregular or occasional periods for years. They might even get pregnant. But people with premature menopause stop having periods and can't become pregnant.
Treatment can restore estrogen levels in people with primary ovarian insufficiency.

The degree of skin and tissue damage ranges from inflamed, unbroken skin to a deep injury involving muscle and bone.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bed-sores/symptoms-causes/syc-20355893
Preterm labor,"Preterm labor happens when regular contractions cause the cervix to open after week 20 and before week 37 of pregnancy.
Preterm labor can result in a baby being born before 37 weeks of pregnancy. The earlier the delivery, the greater the health risks for the baby. Many premature babies, called preemies, need special care in a neonatal intensive care unit. Preemies also can have long-term mental and physical health concerns.
The cause of preterm labor often isn't clear. Certain risk factors can raise the chance of preterm labor. But preterm labor can happen with no known risk factors.","Symptoms of preterm labor include: | Regular or frequent feelings of belly tightening, called contractions. | Dull low backache. | A feeling of pressure in the pelvis or lower belly. | Mild belly cramps. | Vaginal spotting or light bleeding. | A gush or an ongoing trickle of fluid after the sac around the unborn baby, called the fetus, breaks or tears. | Fluid from the vagina that is watery, bloody or filled with mucus.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/preterm-labor/symptoms-causes/syc-20376842

Addison's disease,"Addison's disease is a rare condition that happens when the body doesn't make enough of some hormones. Another name for Addison's disease is primary adrenal insufficiency. With Addison's disease, the adrenal glands make too little of the hormone cortisol. Often, they also make too little of another hormone called aldosterone.
Damage to the adrenal glands causes Addison's disease. Symptoms can start slowly. Early symptoms may include extreme tiredness, salt cravings and weight loss.
Addison's disease can affect anyone. Without treatment, it can be life-threatening. Treatment involves taking lab-made hormones to replace those that are missing.","Addison's disease symptoms usually happen slowly, often over months. The disease may happen so slowly that people who have it might ignore the symptoms at first. Physical stress such as an illness or injury can make symptoms get worse fast. | Early symptoms of Addison's disease can affect you in various ways. Some early symptoms can cause discomfort or loss of energy, including: | Extreme tiredness, also called fatigue. | Dizziness or fainting when standing after sitting or lying down. This is due to a type of low blood pressure called postural hypotension. | Sweating due to low blood sugar, also called hypoglycemia. | Upset stomach, diarrhea or vomiting. | Pain in the stomach area, also called the abdomen. | Muscle cramps, weakness, widespread pain or joint pain. | Other early symptoms can cause changes in how you look, such as: | Body hair loss. | Areas of darkened skin, especially on scars and moles. These changes may be harder to see on Black or brown skin. | Weight loss due to less hunger. | Early Addison's disease symptoms also can affect emotions, mental health and desires.

Primary biliary cholangitis,"Primary biliary cholangitis is an autoimmune disease in which the bile ducts are inflamed and slowly destroyed. It previously was called primary biliary cirrhosis.
Bile is a fluid made in the liver. It helps with digestion and absorbing certain vitamins. It also helps the body absorb fats and get rid of cholesterol, toxins and worn-out red blood cells. Ongoing inflammation in the liver can lead to bile duct inflammation and damage known as cholangitis. At times, this can lead to permanent scarring of liver tissue, called cirrhosis. It also can eventually lead to liver failure.
Although it affects both sexes, primary biliary cholangitis mostly affects women. It's considered an autoimmune disease, which means your body's immune system is mistakenly attacking healthy cells and tissue. Researchers think a combination of genetic and environmental factors triggers the disease. It usually develops slowly. At this time, there's no cure for primary biliary cholangitis, but medicines may slow liver damage, especially if treatment begins early.","More than half of people with primary biliary cholangitis do not have any noticeable symptoms when diagnosed. The disease may be diagnosed when blood tests are done for other reasons, such as routine testing. Symptoms eventually develop over the next 5 to 20 years. Those who do have symptoms at diagnosis typically have poorer outcomes. | Common early symptoms include: | Fatigue. | Itchy skin. | Later signs and symptoms may include: | Yellowing of the skin and eyes, called jaundice. | Dry eyes and mouth. | Pain in the upper right abdomen. | Swelling of the spleen, called splenomegaly. | Bone, muscle or joint pain. | Swollen feet and ankles. | Buildup of fluid in the abdomen due to liver failure, called ascites. | Fatty deposits, called xanthomas, on the skin around the eyes, eyelids or in the creases of the palms, soles, elbows or knees. | Darkening of the skin that's not related to sun exposure, called hyperpigmentation. | Weak and brittle bones, called osteoporosis, which can lead to fractures. | High cholesterol. | Diarrhea that may include greasy stools, called steatorrhea. | Underactive thyroid, called hypothyroidism. | Weight loss.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/primary-biliary-cholangitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20376874

Primary progressive aphasia,"Primary progressive aphasia (uh-FAY-zhuh) is a rare nervous system condition that affects a person's ability to communicate. People who have primary progressive aphasia can have trouble expressing their thoughts and understanding or finding words.
Symptoms develop gradually, often before age 65. They get worse over time. People with primary progressive aphasia can lose the ability to speak and write. Eventually they're not able to understand written or spoken language.
This condition progresses slowly. People who have primary progressive aphasia may continue caring for themselves and participating in daily activities for several years.
Primary progressive aphasia is a type of frontotemporal dementia. Frontotemporal dementia is a cluster of conditions that result from the degeneration of the frontal or temporal lobes of the brain. These areas include brain tissue involved in speech and language. Not all people with primary progressive aphasia have dementia, but most develop it. The term ""dementia"" is typically not used until a person can't do things alone due to changes in their thinking and understanding.",Primary progressive aphasia symptoms vary based on which part of the brain's language areas are involved. The condition has three types. Each type causes different symptoms.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis,"Primary sclerosing (skluh-ROHS-ing) cholangitis (koh-lan-JIE-tis) is a disease of the bile ducts. Bile ducts carry the digestive liquid bile from your liver to your small intestine. In primary sclerosing cholangitis, inflammation causes scars within the bile ducts. These scars make the ducts hard and narrow and gradually cause serious liver damage. A majority of people with primary sclerosing cholangitis also have inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.
In most people with primary sclerosing cholangitis, the disease progresses slowly. It can eventually lead to liver failure, repeated infections, and tumors of the bile duct or liver. A liver transplant is the only known cure for advanced primary sclerosing cholangitis, but the disease may recur in the transplanted liver in a small number of patients.
Care for primary sclerosing cholangitis focuses on monitoring liver function, managing symptoms and, when possible, doing procedures that temporarily open blocked bile ducts.",Primary sclerosing cholangitis is often diagnosed before symptoms appear when a routine blood test or an X-ray taken for an unrelated condition shows liver abnormalities. | Early signs and symptoms often include: | Fatigue | Itching | Yellow eyes and skin (jaundice) | Abdominal pain | Many people diagnosed with primary sclerosing cholangitis before they have symptoms continue to feel generally well for several years.

Progeria,"Progeria (pro-JEER-e-uh), also known as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, is an extremely rare, progressive genetic disorder. It causes children to age rapidly, starting in their first two years of life.
Children with progeria generally appear healthy at birth. During the first year, symptoms such as slowed growth, loss of fat tissue and hair loss begin to appear.
Heart problems or strokes are the eventual cause of death in most children with progeria. The average life expectancy for a child with progeria is about 15 years. Some with the condition may die younger and others may live longer, even to about 20 years.
There's no cure for progeria, but new treatments and research show some promise for managing symptoms and complications.","Usually within the first year of life, you'll notice that your child's growth has slowed. But motor development and intelligence are not affected. | Symptoms of this progressive disorder cause a distinctive appearance. They include: | Slowed growth and poor weight gain, with below-average height and weight. | Lack of fat that's stored just beneath the skin. | Head that is large compared with the face. | Small jaw, chin and mouth and thin lips. | Thin, curved nose with a slight hook at the end, which may look like a bird's beak. | Large eyes and eyelids that don't close completely. | Hair loss, including eyelashes and eyebrows. | Thin, spotty and wrinkled skin. | Veins easily seen through the skin. | High-pitched voice. | Premature aging. | Symptoms also include health issues: | Severe progressive heart and blood vessel disease, also known as cardiovascular disease. | Hardening and tightening of skin. | Delayed tooth formation and tooth shape that is not usual. | Some hearing loss. | Loss of fat under the skin and loss of muscle. | Problems with the growth and development of bones. | Joint problems, including stiff joints. | A hip that's forced out of the correct position, known as hip dislocation. | Dental problems. | No significant progression of puberty. | Insulin resistance, which means the body doesn't respond well to insulin made by an organ called the pancreas.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/progeria/symptoms-causes/syc-20356038
Progressive supranuclear palsy,"Progressive supranuclear palsy is a rare brain disease that affects walking, balance, eye movements and swallowing. The disease results from the damage of cells in areas of the brain that control body movement, coordination, thinking and other important functions. Progressive supranuclear palsy also is called Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome.
Progressive supranuclear palsy worsens over time and can lead to dangerous complications, such as pneumonia and trouble swallowing. There's no cure for progressive supranuclear palsy, so treatment focuses on managing the symptoms.","Symptoms of progressive supranuclear palsy include: | A loss of balance while walking.A tendency to fall backward can occur very early in the disease. | An inability to aim your eyes properly.People with progressive supranuclear palsy may not be able to look downward.

Anterior vaginal prolapse (cystocele),"Anterior vaginal prolapse, also known as a cystocele (SIS-toe-seel) or a prolapsed bladder, is when the bladder drops from its usual position in the pelvis and pushes on the wall of the vagina.
The organs of the pelvis — including the bladder, uterus and intestines — are typically held in place by the muscles and connective tissues of the pelvic floor. Anterior prolapse occurs when the pelvic floor becomes weak or if too much pressure is put on the pelvic floor. This can happen over time, during vaginal childbirth or with chronic constipation, violent coughing or heavy lifting.
Anterior prolapse is treatable. For a mild or moderate prolapse, nonsurgical treatment is often effective. In more severe cases, surgery may be necessary to keep the vagina and other pelvic organs in their proper positions.","In mild cases of anterior prolapse, you may not notice any signs or symptoms. When signs and symptoms occur, they may include: | A feeling of fullness or pressure in your pelvis and vagina | In some cases, a bulge of tissue in your vagina that you can see or feel | Increased pelvic pressure when you strain, cough, bear down or lift | Problems urinating, including difficulty starting a urine stream, the feeling that you haven't completely emptied your bladder after urinating, feeling a frequent need to urinate or leaking urine (urinary incontinence) | Signs and symptoms often are especially noticeable after standing for long periods of time and may go away when you lie down.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cystocele/symptoms-causes/syc-20369452
Prostate cancer,"Prostate cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the prostate. The prostate is a small gland that helps make semen. It's found just below the bladder. The prostate is part of the male reproductive system.
Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer. Prostate cancer is usually found early, and it often grows slowly. Most people with prostate cancer are cured.
People diagnosed with early prostate cancer often have many treatment options to consider. It can feel overwhelming to learn about all the options and make a choice. Treatments may include surgery, radiation therapy or carefully watching the prostate cancer to see if it grows.
If the cancer grows beyond the prostate or if it spreads, there are still many treatment options. Prostate cancer that spreads can be more difficult to cure. But even when a cure isn't possible, treatments can slow the growth of the cancer and help you live longer.","Prostate cancer may not cause symptoms at first. Most prostate cancers are found at an early stage. This means that the cancer is only in the prostate. An early-stage prostate cancer often doesn't cause symptoms. | When they happen, early-stage prostate cancer signs and symptoms can include: | Blood in the urine, which might make the urine look pink, red or cola-colored. | Blood in the semen. | Needing to urinate more often. | Trouble getting started when trying to urinate. | Waking up to urinate more often at night. | If the prostate cancer spreads, other symptoms can happen. Prostate cancer that spreads to other parts of the body is called metastatic prostate cancer. It also might be called stage 4 prostate cancer or advanced prostate cancer. | Signs and symptoms of advanced prostate cancer can include: | Accidental leaking of urine. | Back pain. | Bone pain. | Difficulty getting an erection, called erectile dysfunction. | Feeling very tired. | Losing weight without trying. | Weakness in the arms or legs.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prostate-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353087
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH),"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a health issue that becomes more common with age. It's also called an enlarged prostate. The prostate is a small gland that helps make semen. It's found just below the bladder. And it often gets bigger as you get older.
An enlarged prostate can cause symptoms that may bother you, such as blocking the flow of urine out of the bladder. It also can cause bladder, urinary tract or kidney problems.
Many treatments can helpBPH. These include medicines, surgery and other procedures. Your health care provider can help you choose. The right option depends on things such as:","Common symptoms ofBPHinclude: | Frequent or urgent need to pee, also called urination. | Peeing more often at night. | Trouble starting to pee. | Weak urine stream, or a stream that stops and starts. | Dribbling at the end of urination. | Not being able to fully empty the bladder. | Less common symptoms include: | Urinary tract infection. | Not being able to pee. | Blood in the urine. | The symptoms ofBPHtend to slowly get worse. But sometimes they stay the same or even improve over time. | The size of the prostate doesn't always determine how serious the symptoms are.

Prostatitis,"Prostatitis is a condition of the prostate gland most often linked with swelling and irritation, called inflammation. Prostatitis can make it painful or hard to urinate. It also may cause pain in the groin, pelvic area or genitals. Bacterial infections cause some but not all prostatitis.
The prostate gland, about the size of a walnut, sits just below the bladder in people assigned male at birth. It surrounds the top part of the tube that drains urine from the bladder, called the urethra. The prostate and other sex glands make the fluid that carries sperm during ejaculation. This fluid is called semen.","Symptoms of prostatitis depend on the type of condition. They may include: | Pain or burning feeling when urinating, called dysuria. | Trouble urinating, such as dribbling or trouble starting a stream of urine or keeping it going. | Urinating often, mostly at night, called nocturia. | Urgent need to urinate. | Cloudy urine. | Blood in the urine. | Pain in the belly, groin or lower back. | Pain in the area between the scrotum and rectum, called the perineum. | Pain or discomfort of the penis or testicles. | Painful ejaculation. | Fever, chills, muscle aches and other flu-like symptoms with acute bacterial prostatitis.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prostatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355766

Itchy skin (pruritus),"Itchy skin is an irritating sensation that makes you want to scratch. It's also called pruritus (proo-RIE-tus). Itchy skin is often caused by dry skin and is common in older adults, as skin tends to become drier with age.
Depending on the cause of your itchiness, your skin may look no different than usual or it may be inflamed, rough or have bumps. Repeated scratching can cause raised thick areas of skin that might bleed or become infected.
Many people find relief with self-care measures such as moisturizers, gentle cleansers and lukewarm baths. Long-term relief requires identifying and treating the cause of itchy skin. Common treatments are medicated creams, moist dressings and anti-itch medicines taken by mouth.","Itchy skin can affect small areas, such as the scalp, an arm or a leg. Or it can cover the whole body. Itchy skin can occur without any other noticeable changes on the skin. Or it may come with: | Inflamed skin | Scratch marks | Bumps, spots or blisters | Dry, cracked skin | Leathery or scaly patches | Sometimes itchiness lasts a long time and can be intense.

Psoriasis is a common, long-term (chronic) disease with no cure. It can be painful, interfere with sleep and make it hard to concentrate. The condition tends to go through cycles, flaring for a few weeks or months, then subsiding for a while. Common triggers in people with a genetic predisposition to psoriasis include infections, cuts or burns, and certain medications.
Treatments are available to help you manage symptoms. And you can try lifestyle habits and coping strategies to help you live better with psoriasis.","Common signs and symptoms of psoriasis include: | A patchy rash that varies widely in how it looks from person to person, ranging from spots of dandruff-like scaling to major eruptions over much of the body | Rashes that vary in color, tending to be shades of purple with gray scale on brown or Black skin and pink or red with silver scale on white skin | Small scaling spots (commonly seen in children) | Dry, cracked skin that may bleed | Itching, burning or soreness | Cyclic rashes that flare for a few weeks or months and then subside | There are several types of psoriasis, each of which varies in its signs and symptoms: | Plaque psoriasis.The most common type of psoriasis, plaque psoriasis causes dry, itchy, raised skin patches (plaques) covered with scales. There may be few or many. They usually appear on the elbows, knees, lower back and scalp. The patches vary in color, depending on skin color. The affected skin might heal with temporary changes in color (post inflammatory hyperpigmentation), particularly on brown or Black skin. | Nail psoriasis.Psoriasis can affect fingernails and toenails, causing pitting, abnormal nail growth and discoloration. Psoriatic nails might loosen and separate from the nail bed (onycholysis). Severe disease may cause the nail to crumble. | Guttate psoriasis.Guttate psoriasis primarily affects young adults and children. It's usually triggered by a bacterial infection such as strep throat. It's marked by small, drop-shaped, scaling spots on the trunk, arms or legs. | Inverse psoriasis.Inverse psoriasis mainly affects the skin folds of the groin, buttocks and breasts. It causes smooth patches of inflamed skin that worsen with friction and sweating. Fungal infections may trigger this type of psoriasis. | Pustular psoriasis.Pustular psoriasis, a rare type, causes clearly defined pus-filled blisters. It can occur in widespread patches or on small areas of the palms or soles. | Erythrodermic psoriasis.The least common type of psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis can cover the entire body with a peeling rash that can itch or burn intensely.

Bags under eyes,"Bags under eyes are mild swelling or puffiness under the eyes. They're common as you age and the tissues around your eyes weaken, including some of the muscles supporting your eyelids. Fat that helps support the eyes can then move into the lower eyelids, causing them to appear puffy. Fluid may also accumulate below your eyes.
Bags under eyes are usually a cosmetic concern and rarely a sign of a serious condition. At-home remedies, such as cool compresses, can help improve their appearance. For persistent or bothersome under-eye puffiness, eyelid surgery may be an option.",Symptoms of bags under eyes can include: | Mild swelling | Saggy or loose skin | Dark circles,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bags-under-eyes/symptoms-causes/syc-20369927

Pulmonary embolism,"A pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that blocks and stops blood flow to an artery in the lung. In most cases, the blood clot starts in a deep vein in the leg and travels to the lung. Rarely, the clot forms in a vein in another part of the body. When a blood clot forms in one or more of the deep veins in the body, it's called a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
Because one or more clots block blood flow to the lungs, pulmonary embolism can be life-threatening. However, prompt treatment greatly reduces the risk of death. Taking measures to prevent blood clots in your legs will help protect you against pulmonary embolism.","Pulmonary embolism symptoms can vary greatly, depending on how much of your lung is involved, the size of the clots, and whether you have underlying lung or heart disease. | Common symptoms include: | Shortness of breath.This symptom usually appears suddenly. Trouble catching your breath happens even when resting and gets worse with physical activity. | Chest pain.You may feel like you're having a heart attack. The pain is often sharp and felt when you breathe in deeply. The pain can stop you from being able to take a deep breath. You also may feel it when you cough, bend or lean over. | Fainting.You may pass out if your heart rate or blood pressure drops suddenly. This is called syncope. | Other symptoms that can occur with pulmonary embolism include: | A cough that may include bloody or blood-streaked mucus | Rapid or irregular heartbeat | Lightheadedness or dizziness | Excessive sweating | Fever | Leg pain or swelling, or both, usually in the back of the lower leg | Clammy or discolored skin, called cyanosis",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pulmonary-embolism/symptoms-causes/syc-20354647
Pulmonary fibrosis,"Pulmonary fibrosis is a lung disease that occurs when lung tissue becomes damaged and scarred. This thickened, stiff tissue makes it harder for the lungs to work properly. Pulmonary fibrosis worsens over time. Some people can stay stable for a long time, but the condition gets worse faster in others. As it gets worse, people become more and more short of breath.
The scarring that happens in pulmonary fibrosis can be caused by many things. Often, doctors and other healthcare professionals cannot pinpoint what's causing the problem. When a cause cannot be found, the condition is called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis usually occurs in middle-aged and older adults. Sometimes pulmonary fibrosis is diagnosed in children and infants, but this is not common.
The lung damage caused by pulmonary fibrosis cannot be repaired. Medicines and therapies can sometimes help slow down the rate of fibrosis, ease symptoms and improve quality of life. For some people, a lung transplant might be an option.","Symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis may include: | Shortness of breath. | Dry cough. | Extreme tiredness. | Weight loss that's not intended. | Aching muscles and joints. | Widening and rounding of the tips of the fingers or toes, called clubbing. | How fast pulmonary fibrosis worsens over time and how severe the symptoms are can vary greatly from person to person.

Others have moderate symptoms that worsen more slowly, over months or years.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pulmonary-fibrosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353690
Pulmonary hypertension,"Pulmonary hypertension is a type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in the lungs and the right side of the heart.
In one form of pulmonary hypertension, called pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), blood vessels in the lungs are narrowed, blocked or destroyed. The damage slows blood flow through the lungs. Blood pressure in the lung arteries goes up. The heart must work harder to pump blood through the lungs. The extra effort eventually causes the heart muscle to become weak and fail.
In some people, pulmonary hypertension slowly gets worse and can be life-threatening. There's no cure for pulmonary hypertension. But treatments are available to help you feel better, live longer and improve your quality of life.","The symptoms of pulmonary hypertension develop slowly. You may not notice them for months or even years. Symptoms get worse as the disease progresses. | Pulmonary hypertension symptoms include: | Shortness of breath, at first while exercising and eventually while at rest. | Blue or gray skin color due to low oxygen levels. Depending on your skin color, these changes may be harder or easier to see. | Chest pressure or pain. | Dizziness or fainting spells. | Fast pulse or pounding heartbeat. | Fatigue. | Swelling in the ankles, legs and belly area. | Shortness of breath is the most common symptom of pulmonary hypertension.

Pulmonary valve disease,"Pulmonary valve disease is a type of heart valve disease. It affects the valve between the heart's lower right chamber and the artery that delivers blood to the lungs. That artery is called the pulmonary artery. The valve is called the pulmonary valve.
A diseased or damaged pulmonary valve doesn't work the way it should. It changes how blood flows from the heart to the lungs.
Types of pulmonary valve disease include:","Symptoms of pulmonary valve disease depend on the specific valve condition and how much blood flow is changed or blocked. Some babies are born with pulmonary valve disease. Symptoms may be noticed soon after birth. But sometimes symptoms aren't seen until later in life. | In general, pulmonary valve disease symptoms may include: | Chest pain. | Shortness of breath at rest or when active or lying down. | Fatigue. | Fainting. | Babies born with pulmonary valve disease may have blue or gray skin due to low oxygen levels.

Kidney infection,"A kidney infection is a type of urinary tract infection (UTI). A kidney infection may begin in the tube that carries urine from the body (urethra) or in the bladder. The infection can travel to one or both kidneys. A kidney infection is also called pyelonephritis.
A kidney infection needs prompt medical treatment. If not treated properly, an infection can cause lasting damage to the kidneys. Or the bacteria can spread to the bloodstream and cause a dangerous infection.
Kidney infection treatment often includes antibiotics, which might be given in the hospital.","Symptoms of a kidney infection might include: | Fever | Chills | A burning feeling or pain when urinating | Having to urinate often | A strong, lasting urge to urinate | Back, side or groin pain | Nausea and vomiting | Pus or blood in the urine | Urine that smells bad or is cloudy | Belly pain",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20353387
Pyloric stenosis,"Pyloric stenosis (pie-LOHR-ik stuh-NOH-sis) is a narrowing of the opening between the stomach and the small intestine. This uncommon condition in infants can trap food in the stomach.
Typically, a ring-shaped muscular valve closes to hold food in the stomach or opens to allow food to pass into the small intestine. With pyloric stenosis, the muscle tissue is enlarged. The opening becomes very narrow, and little to no food passes into the intestine.
Pyloric stenosis usually leads to forceful vomiting, dehydration, poor nutrition and weight loss. Babies with pyloric stenosis may seem to be hungry all the time.
Pyloric stenosis is treated with surgery.
The passage between the stomach and small intestine is called the pylorus. The valve that controls the opening may be called the pyloric muscle, pyloric sphincter or pyloric valve.
The enlargement of the pyloric muscle is called hypertrophy. Pyloric stenosis also is called hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.","Symptoms of pyloric stenosis usually appear within 3 to 6 weeks after birth. Pyloric stenosis is rare in babies older than 3 months. | Symptoms include: | Vomiting after feeding.The baby may vomit forcefully, ejecting breast milk or formula up to several feet away. This is known as projectile vomiting. Vomiting usually happens right after feeding. Vomiting might be mild at first and worsen over time. | Constant hunger.Babies who have pyloric stenosis often want to eat soon after vomiting. | Stomach contractions.Wavelike ripples across your baby's belly may be visible after feeding but before vomiting. This is a sign of the stomach muscles trying to move food out of the stomach. | Dehydration.A baby may show signs of low body fluids, also called dehydration. These signs may include few wet diapers, lack of energy, dry mouth and lips, and crying without tears. | Changes in stool.Since pyloric stenosis prevents food from reaching the intestines, babies with this condition might be constipated. | Weight loss.The lack of nutrition can cause a baby not to gain weight or to lose weight.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pyloric-stenosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351416
Pyoderma gangrenosum,"Pyoderma gangrenosum (pie-o-DUR-muh gang-ruh-NO-sum) is a rare condition that causes large, painful sores on the skin. The sores can develop quickly. Most often they appear on the legs.
The exact causes of pyoderma gangrenosum are unknown, but it appears to be a disorder of the immune system. People who have certain other conditions are at higher risk of pyoderma gangrenosum.
The condition usually clears up with treatment. But the sores often leave scars and can show up in new spots.","Pyoderma gangrenosum usually starts with a small bump on the skin. It might look like a spider bite. Within days it can turn into a large and painful open sore. | The sore usually appears on the legs but may develop anywhere on the body. Sometimes it appears around surgical sites. If you have two or more sores, they may grow and merge into one.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pyoderma-gangrenosum/symptoms-causes/syc-20350386
Rheumatoid arthritis,"Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can affect more than just your joints. In some people, the condition can damage a wide variety of body systems, including the skin, eyes, lungs, heart and blood vessels.
An autoimmune disorder, rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system mistakenly attacks your own body's tissues.
Unlike the wear-and-tear damage of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis affects the lining of your joints, causing a painful swelling that can eventually result in bone erosion and joint deformity.
The inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis is what can damage other parts of the body as well. While new types of medications have improved treatment options dramatically, severe rheumatoid arthritis can still cause physical disabilities.","Signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include: | Tender, warm, swollen joints | Joint stiffness that is usually worse in the mornings and after inactivity | Fatigue, fever and loss of appetite | Early rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect your smaller joints first — particularly the joints that attach your fingers to your hands and your toes to your feet. | As the disease progresses, symptoms often spread to the wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, hips and shoulders. In most cases, symptoms occur in the same joints on both sides of your body. | About 40% of people who have rheumatoid arthritis also experience signs and symptoms that don't involve the joints. Areas that may be affected include: | Skin | Eyes | Lungs | Heart | Kidneys | Salivary glands | Nerve tissue | Bone marrow | Blood vessels | Rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms may vary in severity and may even come and go. Periods of increased disease activity, called flares, alternate with periods of relative remission — when the swelling and pain fade or disappear. Over time, rheumatoid arthritis can cause joints to deform and shift out of place.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353648
Rabies,,,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rabies/symptoms-causes/syc-20351821
Radiation enteritis,"Radiation enteritis is inflammation of the intestines that occurs after radiation therapy.
Radiation enteritis causes diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and stomach cramps in people receiving radiation aimed at the abdomen, pelvis or rectum. It's most common in people receiving radiation therapy for cancer in the abdomen and pelvic areas.
For most people, radiation enteritis is temporary, with inflammation usually subsiding several weeks after treatment ends. But for some, radiation enteritis may continue long after radiation therapy ends or may develop months or years after treatment.
Chronic radiation enteritis can cause complications such as anemia, diarrhea or bowel obstruction.
Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms until the inflammation heals. In severe cases, tube feeding or surgery to remove sections of the intestine may be necessary.","The symptoms of radiation enteritis include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and stomach cramps. Symptoms occur because of irritation of the intestines from radiation therapy for cancer. Symptoms usually go away several weeks after treatment ends. But sometimes they last longer. Radiation enteritis that goes on for longer can cause anemia and bowel obstruction.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/radiation-enteritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355409
Radiation sickness,"Radiation sickness is damage to the body caused by a large dose of radiation often received over a short time. This is called acute radiation sickness. The amount of radiation absorbed by the body, called the absorbed dose, determines how bad the illness will be.
Radiation sickness also is called acute radiation syndrome or radiation poisoning. Radiation sickness is not caused by common medical imaging tests that use low-dose radiation, such as X-rays, CT scans and nuclear medicine scans.
Although radiation sickness is serious and often fatal, it's rare. Since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, during World War II, most cases of radiation sickness have occurred after nuclear industrial accidents, such as the 1986 fire that damaged the nuclear power plant at Chernobyl, Ukraine.","The severity of radiation sickness symptoms depends on how much radiation you've absorbed. How much you absorb depends on the strength of the radiated energy, the time of your exposures, and the distance between you and the source of radiation. | Symptoms also are affected by the type of exposure, such as total or partial body. The severity of radiation sickness also depends on how sensitive the affected tissue is. For instance, the gastrointestinal system and bone marrow are highly sensitive to radiation.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/radiation-sickness/symptoms-causes/syc-20377058
Ramsay Hunt syndrome,,,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ramsay-hunt-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20351783
REM sleep behavior disorder,"Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder is a sleep disorder in which you physically act out vivid, often unpleasant dreams with vocal sounds and sudden, often violent arm and leg movements during REM sleep — sometimes called dream-enacting behavior.
You normally don't move during REM sleep, a normal stage of sleep that occurs many times during the night. About 20 percent of your sleep is spent in REM sleep, the usual time for dreaming, which occurs primarily during the second half of the night.
The onset of REM sleep behavior disorder is often gradual and it can get worse with time.
REM sleep behavior disorder may be associated with other neurological conditions, such as Lewy body dementia (also called dementia with Lewy bodies), Parkinson's disease or multiple system atrophy.","With REM sleep behavior disorder, instead of experiencing the normal temporary paralysis of your arms and legs (atonia) during REM sleep, you physically act out your dreams. | The onset can be gradual or sudden, and episodes may occur occasionally or several times a night. The disorder often worsens with time. | Symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorder may include: | Movement, such as kicking, punching, arm flailing or jumping from bed, in response to action-filled or violent dreams, such as being chased or defending yourself from an attack | Noises, such as talking, laughing, shouting, emotional outcries or even cursing | Being able to recall the dream if you awaken during the episode",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rem-sleep-behavior-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20352920

Tachycardia,"Tachycardia (tak-ih-KAHR-dee-uh) is the medical term for a heart rate over 100 beats a minute. Many types of irregular heart rhythms, called arrhythmias, can cause tachycardia.
A fast heart rate isn't always a concern. For instance, the heart rate usually rises during exercise or as a response to stress.
Tachycardia may not cause any symptoms or complications. But sometimes it's a warning of a medical condition that needs attention. Some forms of tachycardia can lead to serious health problems if left untreated. Such problems may include heart failure, stroke or sudden cardiac death.
Treatment for tachycardia may include specific actions or movements, medicine, cardioversion, or surgery to control a rapid heartbeat.","Some people with tachycardia have no symptoms. The fast heartbeat may be discovered when a physical exam or heart tests are done for another reason. | In general, tachycardia may cause these symptoms: | Racing, pounding heartbeat or flopping in the chest, called palpitations. | Chest pain. | Fainting. | Lightheadedness. | Rapid pulse. | Shortness of breath.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tachycardia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355127
Poison ivy rash,"Poison ivy rash is caused by an allergic reaction to an oily resin called urushiol (u-ROO-she-ol). This oil is in the leaves, stems and roots of poison ivy, poison oak and poison sumac.
Wash your skin right away if you come into contact with this oil, unless you know you're not sensitive to it. Washing off the oil may reduce your chances of getting a poison ivy rash. If you develop a rash, it can be very itchy and last for weeks.
You can treat mild cases of poison ivy rash at home with soothing lotions and cool baths. You may need prescription medication for a rash that's severe or widespread — especially if it's on your face or genitals.","Signs and symptoms of a poison ivy rash include: | Redness | Itching | Swelling | Blisters | Difficulty breathing, if you've inhaled the smoke from burning poison ivy | Poison ivy rash often appears in a straight line because of the way the plant brushes against your skin. But if you develop a rash after touching a piece of clothing or pet fur that has urushiol on it, the rash may be more spread out. You can also transfer the oil to other parts of your body with your fingers. The reaction usually develops 12 to 48 hours after exposure and lasts two to three weeks. | The severity of the rash depends on the amount of urushiol that gets on your skin.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/poison-ivy/symptoms-causes/syc-20376485
Raynaud's disease,"Raynaud's (ray-NOSE) disease causes some areas of the body — such as fingers and toes — to feel numb and cold in response to cold temperatures or stress. In Raynaud's disease, smaller blood vessels that supply blood to the skin narrow. This limits blood flow to affected areas, which is called vasospasm.
Other names for this condition are:
Women are more likely than men to have Raynaud's disease. It seems to be more common in people who live in colder climates.
Treatment of Raynaud's disease depends on how bad it is and whether you have other health conditions. For most people, Raynaud's disease isn't disabling, but it can affect your quality of life.","Symptoms of Raynaud's disease include: | Cold fingers or toes. | Areas of skin that turn white then blue. Depending on your skin color, these color changes may be harder or easier to see. | Numb, prickly feeling or stinging pain upon warming or easing of stress. | During an attack of Raynaud's, affected areas of the skin usually first turn pale. Next, they often change color and feel cold and numb. When the skin warms and blood flow improves, the affected areas may change color again, throb, tingle or swell. | Raynaud's most commonly affects fingers and toes. But it also can affect other areas of the body, such as nose, lips, ears and even nipples. After warming up, the return of blood flow to the area can take 15 minutes.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/raynauds-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20363571

Dyslexia,"Dyslexia is a learning disorder that involves difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words (decoding). Also called a reading disability, dyslexia is a result of individual differences in areas of the brain that process language.
Dyslexia is not due to problems with intelligence, hearing or vision. Most children with dyslexia can succeed in school with tutoring or a specialized education program. Emotional support also plays an important role.
Though there's no cure for dyslexia, early assessment and intervention result in the best outcome. Sometimes dyslexia goes undiagnosed for years and isn't recognized until adulthood, but it's never too late to seek help.","Signs of dyslexia can be difficult to recognize before your child enters school, but some early clues may indicate a problem. Once your child reaches school age, your child's teacher may be the first to notice a problem. Severity varies, but the condition often becomes apparent as a child starts learning to read.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dyslexia/symptoms-causes/syc-20353552
Medication overuse headaches,"Medication overuse headaches are the result of the long-term use of medicines needed to treat headaches such as migraines. It's OK to take pain relievers for headaches sometimes. But people who take them more than a couple of days a week may get medication overuse headaches, also called rebound headaches.
For people with a headache condition such as migraine, most medicines for pain relief can have this effect. This doesn't seem true for people who have never had a headache condition. But people with a history of headaches who take pain relievers regularly for another condition, such as arthritis, may get medicine overuse headaches.
Medication overuse headaches most often go away after stopping the pain medicine. This can make it challenging to manage pain in the short term. But your healthcare professional can help you find ways to
prevent medication overuse headaches.",Symptoms of medication overuse headaches depend on the type of headache being treated and the medicine used. Medication overuse headaches tend to: | Happen every day or nearly every day. These headaches often wake people from sleep. | Improve with pain medicine but then return as the medicine wears off. | Other symptoms may include: | Nausea. | Restlessness. | Trouble concentrating. | Memory problems. | Irritability.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/medication-overuse-headache/symptoms-causes/syc-20377083
Rectal cancer,"Rectal cancer is a kind of cancer that starts as a growth of cells in the rectum. The rectum is the last several inches of the large intestine. It starts at the end of the final segment of the colon and ends when it reaches the short, narrow passage known as the anus.
Cancer inside the rectum and cancer inside the colon are often referred to together as colorectal cancer.
While rectal and colon cancers are similar in many ways, their treatments are quite different. This is mainly because the rectum is barely separated from other organs and structures. It sits in a tight space that can make surgery to remove rectal cancer complex.
Rectal cancer treatment usually involves surgery to remove the cancer. Other treatments may include chemotherapy, radiation or a combination of the two. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy also may be used.","Rectal cancer may not cause symptoms early on. Symptoms of rectal cancer usually happen when the disease is advanced. | Signs and symptoms of rectal cancer include: | A change in bowel habits, such as diarrhea, constipation or a more-frequent need to pass stool. | A feeling that the bowel doesn't empty completely. | Abdominal pain. | Dark maroon or bright red blood in stool. | Narrow stool. | Weight loss that happens without trying. | Weakness or fatigue.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rectal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352884

Anal itching,"Anal itching is a common condition. The itch in or around the anus is often intense and can be embarrassing and uncomfortable.
Anal itching, also called pruritus ani (proo-RIE-tus A-nie), has several possible causes. They include infections, hemorrhoids and ongoing diarrhea.  Skin inflammation, also called dermatitis, is another cause.
If the symptoms don't clear up with self-care, talk with your health care provider. With treatment, most people get complete relief.","Symptoms of anal itching may include intense itching, inflammation, burning and soreness. The itching and irritation may be short lived or more persistent, depending on the cause. Anal itching often is worse at bedtime or in hot, humid weather.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anal-itching/symptoms-causes/syc-20369345
Rectal prolapse,"Rectal prolapse happens when part of the large intestine's lowest section, the rectum, slips outside the muscular opening at the end of the digestive tract known as the anus. While rectal prolapse may cause pain, it's rarely a medical emergency.
Rectal prolapse is sometimes treated with stool softeners, suppositories and other medicines. But surgery is usually needed to treat rectal prolapse.","If you have rectal prolapse, you may notice a reddish lump that comes out of the anus, often while straining during a bowel movement. The lump may slip back inside the anus, or it may continue to be seen. | Other symptoms may include: | You cannot control your bowel movements, known as fecal incontinence. | Constipation or loose stools. | Leaking blood or mucus from the rectum. | Feeling that your rectum isn't empty after a bowel movement.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rectal-prolapse/symptoms-causes/syc-20352837

Rectovaginal fistula,"A rectovaginal fistula is a connection that should not exist between the lower part of the large intestine — the rectum or anus — and the vagina. Bowel contents can leak through the fistula, allowing gas or stool to pass through the vagina.
A rectovaginal fistula may result from:
The condition may cause gas and stool to leak out of the vagina. This may lead to emotional distress and physical discomfort for you, which may impact your self-esteem and intimacy.
Talk with your health care provider if you have symptoms of a rectovaginal fistula, even if it's embarrassing. Some rectovaginal fistulas may close on their own, but most need surgery to fix them.","The most common symptom of a rectovaginal fistula is passing gas or stool from the vagina. Depending on the fistula's size and location, you may have only minor symptoms. Or you may have significant problems with stool and gas leakage and keeping the area clean.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rectovaginal-fistula/symptoms-causes/syc-20377108
Recurrent breast cancer,"Recurrent breast cancer is breast cancer that comes back after initial treatment. Although the initial treatment is aimed at eliminating all cancer cells, a few may have evaded treatment and survived. These undetected cancer cells multiply, becoming recurrent breast cancer.
Recurrent breast cancer may occur months or years after your initial treatment. The cancer may come back in the same place as the original cancer (local recurrence), or it may spread to other areas of your body (distant recurrence).
Learning you have recurrent breast cancer may be harder than dealing with the initial diagnosis. But having recurrent breast cancer is far from hopeless. Treatment may eliminate local, regional or distant recurrent breast cancer. Even if a cure isn't possible, treatment may control the disease for long periods of time.",Signs and symptoms of recurrent breast cancer vary depending on where the cancer comes back.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/recurrent-breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20377135
Canker sore,"Canker sores, also called aphthous ulcers, are small, shallow lesions that develop on the soft tissues in your mouth or at the base of your gums. Unlike cold sores, canker sores don't occur on the surface of your lips and they aren't contagious. They can be painful, however, and can make eating and talking difficult.
Most canker sores go away on their own in a week or two. Check with your doctor or dentist if you have unusually large or painful canker sores or canker sores that don't seem to heal.","Most canker sores are round or oval with a white or yellow center and a red border. They form inside your mouth — on or under your tongue, inside your cheeks or lips, at the base of your gums, or on your soft palate. You might notice a tingling or burning sensation a day or two before the sores actually appear. | There are several types of canker sores, including minor, major and herpetiform sores.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/canker-sore/symptoms-causes/syc-20370615

Bile reflux,,,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bile-reflux/symptoms-causes/syc-20370115
Vesicoureteral reflux,"Vesicoureteral (ves-ih-koe-yoo-REE-tur-ul) reflux means that some urine flows in the wrong direction once it reaches the bladder. It flows back up tubes called ureters that connect the kidneys to the bladder. Typically, urine flows from the kidneys through the ureters down to the bladder. It's not supposed to flow back up.
Most often, vesicoureteral reflux is found in infants and children. Some are born with vesicoureteral reflux due to an issue with the structure of one of the two ureters. Others develop the condition later for reasons such as the bladder not being able to empty fully.
With vesicoureteral reflux, urine can carry germs from the bladder up to the kidneys. That raises the risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs).UTIscan happen in any of the organs that make urine and remove it from the body. These infections can cause symptoms such as a strong need to urinate and pain while urinating. Without treatment,UTIscan lead to kidney damage.
Some children who are born with vesicoureteral reflux outgrow it. Others need treatment such as medicine or surgery. The goal of treatment is to prevent kidney damage and moreUTIs.","Vesicoureteral reflux symptoms often are due to a urinary tract infection (UTI). AUTIdoesn't always cause symptoms, but most people notice some. | These symptoms can include: | A strong, constant urge to urinate. | A burning feeling when urinating. | The need to pass small amounts of urine often. | Cloudy urine. | Fever. | Pain in the side, groin or stomach area. | Babies and some small children withUTIscan't tell adults what their symptoms feel like. But they may have: | A fever for no clear reason. | Lack of hunger. | Fussiness. | As a child gets older, vesicoureteral reflux that doesn't get treated can lead to: | Bed-wetting. | Constipation or loss of control over bowel movements. | High blood pressure. | Protein in urine. | Urgent need to urinate or urinating more often than usual. | Leaking urine by accident, also called urinary incontinence. | Another symptom of vesicoureteral reflux is swelling of one or both kidneys. This swelling is called hydronephrosis. It's caused by the backup of urine into the kidneys. An imaging test called an ultrasound often finds this swelling before a baby is born.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vesicoureteral-reflux/symptoms-causes/syc-20378819
Aortic valve regurgitation,"Aortic valve regurgitation — also called aortic regurgitation — is a type of heart valve disease. The valve between the lower left heart chamber and the body's main artery doesn't close tightly. As a result, some of the blood pumped out of the heart's main pumping chamber, called the left ventricle, leaks backward.
The leakage may prevent the heart from doing a good enough job of pumping blood to the rest of the body. You may feel tired and short of breath.
Aortic valve regurgitation can develop suddenly or over many years. Once the condition becomes severe, surgery often is needed to repair or replace the valve.","Most often, aortic valve regurgitation develops over time. You may have no symptoms for years. You might not realize that you have the condition. But sometimes, aortic valve regurgitation occurs suddenly. Usually, this is due to an infection of the valve. | As aortic valve regurgitation becomes worse, symptoms may include: | Shortness of breath with exercise or when lying down. | Tiredness and weakness, especially when being more active than usual. | Irregular heartbeat. | Lightheadedness or fainting. | Pain, discomfort or tightness in the chest, which often gets worse during exercise. | Sensations of a rapid, fluttering heartbeat, called palpitations. | Swollen ankles and feet.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aortic-valve-regurgitation/symptoms-causes/syc-20353129
Mitral valve regurgitation,"Mitral valve regurgitation is the most common type of heart valve disease. In this condition, the valve between the left heart chambers doesn't close fully. Blood leaks backward across the valve. If the leakage is severe, not enough blood moves through the heart or to the rest of the body. Mitral valve regurgitation can make you feel very tired or short of breath.
Other names for mitral valve regurgitation are:
Treatment of mitral valve regurgitation may include regular health checkups, medicines or surgery. You may not need treatment if the condition is mild.
Severe mitral valve regurgitation often requires a catheter procedure or heart surgery to repair or replace the mitral valve. Without proper treatment, severe mitral valve regurgitation can cause heart rhythm problems or heart failure.","Mitral valve regurgitation is often mild and develops slowly. Some people do not have symptoms for many years. | But sometimes, mitral valve regurgitation develops quickly. When this happens, it's called acute mitral valve regurgitation. | Fatigue is a common but nonspecific symptom of mitral valve regurgitation. Other symptoms of mitral valve regurgitation include: | Irregular heartbeat, called an arrhythmia. | Shortness of breath, especially when lying down. | Feelings of a rapid, pounding or fluttering heartbeat, called palpitations. | Swollen feet or ankles.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mitral-valve-regurgitation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350178
Renal artery stenosis,"Renal artery stenosis is the narrowing of one or more arteries that carry blood to your kidneys (renal arteries).
Narrowing of the arteries prevents enough oxygen-rich blood from reaching your kidneys. Your kidneys need adequate blood flow to help filter waste products and remove excess fluids. Reduced blood flow to your kidneys may injure kidney tissue and increase blood pressure throughout your body.","Renal artery stenosis often doesn't cause any signs or symptoms until it's advanced. The condition may be discovered incidentally during testing for something else. Your health care provider may also suspect a problem if you have: | High blood pressure that begins suddenly or worsens without explanation | High blood pressure that begins before age 30 or after age 50 | As renal artery stenosis progresses, other signs and symptoms may include: | High blood pressure that's hard to control | A whooshing sound as blood flows through a narrowed vessel (bruit), which your doctor hears through a stethoscope placed over your kidneys | Elevated protein levels in the urine or other signs of a problem with kidney function | Worsening kidney function during treatment for high blood pressure | Fluid overload and swelling in your body's tissues | Treatment-resistant heart failure",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/renal-artery-stenosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352777
Kidney cancer,"Kidney cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the kidneys. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They're located behind the abdominal organs, with one kidney on each side of the spine.
In adults, renal cell carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer. Other, less common types of kidney cancer can happen. Young children are more likely to develop a kind of kidney cancer called Wilms tumor.
The number of kidney cancers diagnosed each year seems to be increasing. One reason for this may be the fact that imaging techniques such as CT scans are being used more often. These tests may lead to the incidental discovery of more kidney cancers. Kidney cancer is often found when the cancer is small and confined to the kidney.","Kidney cancer doesn't usually cause symptoms at first. In time, signs and symptoms may develop, including: | Blood in the urine, which may appear pink, red or cola colored. | Loss of appetite. | Pain in the side or back that doesn't go away. | Tiredness. | Unexplained weight loss.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352664
Kidney stones,"Kidney stones (also called renal calculi, nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis) are hard deposits made of minerals and salts that form inside your kidneys.
Diet, excess body weight, some medical conditions, and certain supplements and medications are among the many causes of kidney stones. Kidney stones can affect any part of your urinary tract — from your kidneys to your bladder. Often, stones form when the urine becomes concentrated, allowing minerals to crystallize and stick together.
Passing kidney stones can be quite painful, but the stones usually cause no permanent damage if they're recognized in a timely fashion. Depending on your situation, you may need nothing more than to take pain medication and drink lots of water to pass a kidney stone.  In other instances — for example, if stones become lodged in the urinary tract, are associated with a urinary infection or cause complications — surgery may be needed.
Your doctor may recommend preventive treatment to reduce your risk of recurrent kidney stones if you're at increased risk of developing them again.","A kidney stone usually will not cause symptoms until it moves around within the kidney or passes into one of the ureters. The ureters are the tubes that connect the kidneys and bladder. | If a kidney stone becomes lodged in the ureters, it may block the flow of urine and cause the kidney to swell and the ureter to spasm, which can be very painful. At that point, you may experience these symptoms: | Severe, sharp pain in the side and back, below the ribs | Pain that radiates to the lower abdomen and groin | Pain that comes in waves and fluctuates in intensity | Pain or burning sensation while urinating | Other signs and symptoms may include: | Pink, red or brown urine | Cloudy or foul-smelling urine | A persistent need to urinate, urinating more often than usual or urinating in small amounts | Nausea and vomiting | Fever and chills if an infection is present | Pain caused by a kidney stone may change — for instance, shifting to a different location or increasing in intensity — as the stone moves through your urinary tract.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-stones/symptoms-causes/syc-20355755

Restless legs syndrome,"Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a condition that causes a very strong urge to move the legs. The urge to move usually is caused by an uncomfortable feeling in the legs. It typically happens in the evening or at night when sitting or lying down. Moving eases the discomfort for a short time.
Restless legs syndrome can begin at any age and tends to get worse with age. It can disrupt sleep, which interferes with daily activities.RLSalso is known as Willis-Ekbom disease.
Simple self-care steps and lifestyle changes may help relieve symptoms. Medicines also help many people withRLS.","The chief symptom of restless legs syndrome is an urge to move the legs. It's common to experience: | Uncomfortable sensations that begin while resting.A feeling in the legs typically begins after you've been lying down or sitting for an extended time. It might happen while sitting in a car, airplane or movie theater. | Relief with movement.The sensation ofRLSlessens with movement. Stretching, jiggling the legs, pacing or walking may improve symptoms. | Worsening of symptoms in the evening.Symptoms occur mainly at night. | Nighttime leg twitching.RLSmay be associated with another, more common condition called periodic limb movement of sleep. This condition causes the legs to twitch and kick during sleep, possibly throughout the night. | People typically describeRLSsymptoms as compelling, unpleasant feelings in the legs or feet. They usually happen on both sides of the body. Less commonly, the sensations affect the arms. | The sensations are felt within the leg rather than on the skin. They're described as: | Crawling. | Creeping. | Pulling. | Throbbing. | Aching. | Itching. | Electric. | Sometimes the feelings ofRLSare hard to explain. People withRLSusually don't describe the condition as a muscle cramp or numbness. They do, however, consistently describe the desire to move the legs. | It's common for symptoms to get better and worse.

Retinal detachment,"Retinal detachment happens when the thin layer of tissue at the back of the eye pulls away from its regular position. This layer of tissue is called the retina. Retinal detachment is an emergency.
Retinal detachment separates the retinal cells from the layer of blood vessels that provides oxygen and nourishment to the eye. The longer retinal detachment goes without treatment, the greater the risk of permanent vision loss in the affected eye.
Symptoms of retinal detachment can include the following: reduced vision, the sudden appearance of dark floating shapes and flashes of light in your vision, and loss of side vision. Contacting an eye doctor, called an ophthalmologist, right away can help save your vision.","Retinal detachment is painless. Often, symptoms are present before a retinal detachment happens or before it has gotten worse. You may notice symptoms such as: | The sudden appearance of tiny specks or squiggly lines that seem to drift through your field of vision. These are called floaters. | Flashes of light in one or both eyes. These are called photopsias. | Blurred vision. | Side vision, also called peripheral vision, that becomes worse. | A curtainlike shadow over your field of vision.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/retinal-detachment/symptoms-causes/syc-20351344
Retinal diseases,"Retinal diseases vary widely, but most of them cause visual symptoms. Retinal diseases can affect any part of your retina, a thin layer of tissue on the inside back wall of the eye.
The retina contains millions of light-sensitive cells, called rods and cones, and other nerve cells that receive and organize visual information. The retina sends this information to the brain through the optic nerve, enabling you to see.
Treatment is available for some retinal diseases. Depending on your condition, treatment goals may be to stop or slow the disease. This may help preserve, improve or restore your vision. Untreated, some retinal diseases can cause severe vision loss or blindness.",Many retinal diseases share some common symptoms. These may include: | Seeing floating specks or cobwebs. | Blurred or distorted vision in which straight lines can look wavy. | Defects in the side vision. | Vision loss. | You may need to try looking with each eye alone to notice these changes.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/retinal-diseases/symptoms-causes/syc-20355825
Retinoblastoma,"Retinoblastoma is a kind of eye cancer that starts as a growth of cells in the retina. The retina is the light-sensitive lining on the inside of the eye.
The retina is made up of nerve tissue that senses light as it comes in through the front of the eye. The light causes the retina to send signals to the brain. The brain interprets the signals as images.
Retinoblastoma happens most often in young children. It's usually diagnosed before age 2. It most often affects one eye. Sometimes it happens in both eyes.
There are several treatments for retinoblastoma. For most children, treatment doesn't require removing the eye to get rid of the cancer. The outlook for children diagnosed with retinoblastoma is quite good.",Retinoblastoma signs and symptoms include: | A white color in the center circle of the eye when light is shone in the eye. It might show up in flash photos. | Eye redness. | Eye swelling. | Eyes that seem to be looking in different directions. | Vision loss.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/retinoblastoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20351008

Retractile testicle,"A retractile testicle is a testicle that may move back and forth between the scrotum and the groin. When the retractile testicle is in the groin, it might be easily guided by hand into its proper position in the scrotum — the bag of skin hanging behind the penis — during a physical exam. Upon release, the testicle will remain in the proper position at least temporarily.
For most boys, the problem of a retractile testicle goes away sometime before or during puberty. The testicle moves to its correct location in the scrotum and stays there permanently.
Sometimes the retractile testicle remains in the groin and is no longer movable. When this happens, the condition is called an ascending testicle or an acquired undescended testicle.","Testicles form in the abdomen during fetal development. During the final months of development, the testicles gradually descend into the scrotum. If this descent isn't completed at birth, the testicle usually descends within a few months. If your son has a retractile testicle, the testicle originally descended as it should, but doesn't remain in place. | Symptoms of a retractile testicle include: | The testicle may be moved by hand from the groin into the scrotum and won't immediately retreat to the groin. | The testicle might spontaneously appear in the scrotum and remain there for a time. | The testicle might spontaneously disappear again for a time. | Retractile testicle is different from undescended testicle (cryptorchidism). An undescended testicle is one that never entered the scrotum.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/retractile-testicle/symptoms-causes/syc-20377197

Reye's syndrome,"Reye's syndrome is a serious condition that causes swelling in the liver and brain. It can occur at any age but usually affects children and teenagers after a viral infection, most commonly the flu or chickenpox. Reye's syndrome is rare. The condition also is known as Reye syndrome.
Symptoms such as confusion, seizures and loss of consciousness need emergency treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment of Reye's syndrome can save a child's life.
Aspirin has been linked with Reye's syndrome in children or teenagers who have the flu or chickenpox. Do not give children or teenagers aspirin. To treat fever or pain, consider giving your child infants' or children's acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others). Infants' or children's acetaminophen and ibuprofen medicines are safer alternatives to aspirin. Talk to your healthcare professional if you have concerns.","The symptoms of Reye's syndrome usually start about 3 to 5 days after a viral infection begins. The viral infection may be the flu, also known as influenza, or chickenpox. Or Reye's syndrome may develop after an upper respiratory infection such as a cold. | In Reye's syndrome, a child's blood sugar usually drops while levels of ammonia and acidity in the blood rise. The liver also may swell, and fats may build up. Swelling may occur in the brain.

Although rhabdomyosarcoma can start anywhere in the body, it's more likely to start in the:
Rhabdomyosarcoma treatment often involves surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Treatment depends on where the cancer starts, how large it grows and whether it spreads to other parts of the body.
Research into diagnosis and treatment have greatly improved the outlook for people diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma. More and more people are living for years after a rhabdomyosarcoma diagnosis.","Signs and symptoms of rhabdomyosarcoma depend on where the cancer starts. | For example, if the cancer is in the head or neck area, symptoms may include: | Headache. | Bleeding in the nose, throat or ears. | Tearing, bulging or swelling of the eyes. | If the cancer is in the urinary or reproductive system, symptoms may include: | A mass or bleeding in the vagina or rectum. | Trouble urinating and blood in the urine. | Trouble with bowel movements. | If the cancer is in the arms or legs, symptoms may include: | Possibly pain in the affected area, if the cancer pushes on nerves or other areas of the body. | Swelling or a lump in the arm or leg.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rhabdomyosarcoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20390962
Rheumatic fever,"Rheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease that can develop when strep throat or scarlet fever isn't properly treated. Strep throat and scarlet fever are caused by an infection with streptococcus (strep-toe-KOK-us) bacteria.
Rheumatic fever most often affects children ages 5 to 15. But younger children and adults can get it too. Rheumatic fever is rare in the United States and other developed countries.
Rheumatic fever can cause long-lasting heart damage, including heart valve problems and heart failure. Treatment includes medicines to kill the strep bacteria. Other medicines are used to treat pain and prevent complications.","Rheumatic fever symptoms usually start about 2 to 4 weeks after a strep throat infection.

Hay fever,"Hay fever, also called allergic rhinitis, causes cold-like symptoms. These may include a runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, sneezing and sinus pressure. But unlike a cold, hay fever isn't caused by a virus. Hay fever is caused by an allergic response to a harmless outdoor or indoor substance the body identifies as harmful (allergen).
Common allergens that can trigger hay fever symptoms include pollen and dust mites. Tiny flecks of skin shed by cats, dogs, and other animals with fur or feathers (pet dander) also can be allergens.
Besides making you miserable, hay fever can affect how well you perform at work or school and can generally interfere with your life. But you don't have to put up with annoying symptoms. You can learn to avoid triggers and find the right treatment.","Hay fever symptoms can include: | Runny nose and nasal stuffiness, called congestion. | Watery, itchy, red eyes. | Sneezing. | Cough. | Itchy nose, roof of mouth or throat. | Mucus that runs down the back of the throat, called postnasal drip. | Swollen, bruised-appearing skin under the eyes, known as allergic shiners. | Extreme tiredness and fatigue, often due to poor sleep.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hay-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20373039

Many broken ribs are simply cracked. Cracked ribs are painful. But they don't cause the problems that ribs that have broken into pieces can. The sharp edge of a broken bone can harm major blood vessels or lungs and other organs.
Usually, broken ribs heal on their own in about six weeks. Pain control is important for being able to breathe deeply and avoid lung issues, such as pneumonia.",The following can cause pain with a broken rib or make pain worse: | A deep breath. | Pressure on the injured area. | A bend or a twist of the body.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-ribs/symptoms-causes/syc-20350763

Tinnitus,"Tinnitus is when you experience ringing or other noises in one or both of your ears. The noise you hear when you have tinnitus isn't caused by an external sound, and other people usually can't hear it. Tinnitus is a common problem. It affects about 15% to 20% of people, and is especially common in older adults.
Tinnitus is usually caused by an underlying condition, such as age-related hearing loss, an ear injury or a problem with the circulatory system. For many people, tinnitus improves with treatment of the underlying cause or with other treatments that reduce or mask the noise, making tinnitus less noticeable.","Tinnitus is most often described as a ringing in the ears, even though no external sound is present. However, tinnitus can also cause other types of phantom noises in your ears, including: | Buzzing | Roaring | Clicking | Hissing | Humming | Most people who have tinnitus have subjective tinnitus, or tinnitus that only you can hear. The noises of tinnitus may vary in pitch from a low roar to a high squeal, and you may hear it in one or both ears. In some cases, the sound can be so loud it interferes with your ability to concentrate or hear external sound. Tinnitus may be present all the time, or it may come and go. | In rare cases, tinnitus can occur as a rhythmic pulsing or whooshing sound, often in time with your heartbeat. This is called pulsatile tinnitus.

Intermittent explosive disorder,"Intermittent explosive disorder involves repeated, sudden bouts of impulsive, aggressive, violent behavior or angry verbal outbursts. The reactions are too extreme for the situation. Road rage, domestic abuse, throwing or breaking objects, or other temper tantrums may be symptoms of intermittent explosive disorder.
These explosive outbursts, which occur off and on, cause major distress. They can harm relationships and cause problems at work or school. They also can result in problems with the law.
Intermittent explosive disorder is a long-term condition that can go on for years. But the severity of outbursts may lessen with age. Treatment involves talk therapy and medicine to help you control your aggressive impulses.","Impulsive attacks and angry outbursts occur suddenly, with little or no warning.

The regurgitated food is then chewed again and swallowed or spit out. People with rumination syndrome don't try to regurgitate food. It happens without any effort.
Because the food hasn't yet been digested, it reportedly tastes like regular food and isn't acidic like vomit. Rumination typically happens at every meal, soon after eating.
It's not clear how many people have this condition. Treatment may include behavioral therapy or medicine. Behavioral therapy typically involves teaching people to breathe from the diaphragm.","Symptoms of rumination syndrome include: | Effortless regurgitation, typically within minutes of eating. | Belly pain or pressure relieved by regurgitation. | A feeling of fullness. | Nausea. | Losing weight without trying. | Rumination syndrome isn't usually associated with retching.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rumination-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20377330

Herniated disk,"A herniated disk refers to a problem with one of the rubbery cushions, called disks, that sit between the bones that stack to make the spine. These bones are called vertebrae.
A spinal disk has a soft, jellylike center called a nucleus. The nucleus is encased in a tougher, rubbery exterior, known as the annulus. A herniated disk occurs when some of the nucleus pushes out through a tear in the annulus. A herniated disk is sometimes called a slipped disk or a ruptured disk.
A herniated disk, which can occur in any part of the spine, most often occurs in the lower back. Depending on where the herniated disk is, it can result in pain, numbness or weakness in an arm or a leg.
Many people have no symptoms from a herniated disk. For people who do have symptoms, the symptoms tend to improve over time. Surgery is usually not needed to relieve the problem.","Most herniated disks occur in the lower back, but they also can occur in the neck. Symptoms depend on where the disk is sitting and whether the disk is pressing on a nerve.

A forceful blow to your stomach — during a sporting accident, a fistfight or a car crash, for example — is the usual cause of a ruptured spleen. If you have an enlarged spleen, a less forceful trauma might cause rupture. Without emergency treatment, the internal bleeding caused by a ruptured spleen can be life-threatening.
Some people with ruptured spleens need emergency surgery. Others can be treated with several days of hospital care.","Signs and symptoms of a ruptured spleen include: | Pain in the upper left stomach. | Tenderness when you touch the upper left stomach. | Left shoulder pain. | Confusion, lightheadedness or dizziness.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ruptured-spleen/symptoms-causes/syc-20352317

The salivary glands make saliva. Saliva aids in digestion, keeps the mouth moist and supports healthy teeth. There are three pairs of major salivary glands under and behind the jaw. These are the parotid, sublingual and submandibular glands. Many other tiny salivary glands are in the lips, inside the cheeks, and throughout the mouth and throat.
Salivary gland tumors can happen in any salivary gland. Most salivary gland tumors occur in the parotid gland. Of these, most aren't cancer. For every five parotid gland tumors, on average, only one is found to be cancerous.
Treatment for salivary gland tumors is usually with surgery to remove the tumor. People with salivary gland cancers may need additional treatments.",Signs and symptoms of a salivary gland tumor may include: | A lump or swelling on or near the jaw or in the neck or mouth. | Muscle weakness on one side of the face. | Numbness in part of the face. | Ongoing pain near a salivary gland. | Trouble opening the mouth widely. | Trouble swallowing.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/salivary-gland-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20354151

Sarcoidosis,"Sarcoidosis is a condition that causes tiny collections of immune system cells in any part of the body. These tiny collections form red, swollen lumps called granulomas. Granulomas most commonly occur in the lungs and the lymph nodes of the chest. They also can occur in the eyes, skin, heart and other organs.
Experts don't know the exact cause of sarcoidosis, but it's likely a mix of genetic and environmental factors. Some people appear to have gene changes that make them more likely to develop sarcoidosis. The condition may then be triggered by bacteria, viruses, dust or chemicals. Their immune system overreacts to the trigger, causing inflammation that forms granulomas.
There is no cure for sarcoidosis, but most people do not need treatment. Sarcoidosis may go away on its own. Other people need treatment to lessen their body's immune system response. Sometimes sarcoidosis can last for years and may cause organ damage.","Symptoms of sarcoidosis vary, depending on which organs are affected and how badly they're affected. Sarcoidosis sometimes develops slowly over time and causes symptoms that last for years. Other times, symptoms appear suddenly and then disappear just as quickly. Many people with sarcoidosis have no symptoms, so the condition is found only when a chest X-ray is done for another reason.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sarcoidosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350358
Sarcoma,"Sarcoma refers to a broad group of cancers that start in the bones and soft tissues. Soft tissues connect, support and surround other body structures. Soft tissues include muscle, fat, blood vessels, nerves, tendons and the lining of the joints. Cancer that starts in the soft tissue is called soft tissue sarcoma.
There are many types of sarcomas. They can happen in many parts of the body. Treatment for sarcoma varies depending on sarcoma type, where it is and other factors.","Signs and symptoms of sarcoma include: | A lump that can be felt through the skin that may or may not be painful. | Bone pain. | A bone that breaks with no clear cause, such as with a minor injury or no injury. | Belly pain. | Weight loss.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sarcoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20351048
Bone cancer,"Bone cancer is a growth of cells that starts in a bone. Bone cancer can start in any bone. But it most often affects the thighbone.
The term ""bone cancer"" doesn't include cancer that starts in another part of the body and spreads to the bones. Instead, cancer that spreads to the bone is named for the place it began. For example, cancer that starts in the lungs and spreads to the bones is still lung cancer. Healthcare professionals might call it lung cancer that has metastasized to the bones.
Cancer that starts in the bones is rare. Different types of bone cancers exist. Some types of bone cancers mostly happen in children. Other types happen mostly in adults.
Common bone cancer treatments include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. The best treatment for your bone cancer depends on the type of bone cancer, which bone is affected and other factors.","Signs and symptoms of bone cancer include: | Bone pain. | Swelling and tenderness near the affected area. | Weakened bone, which can lead to a broken bone. | Feeling very tired. | Losing weight without trying.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bone-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20350217
Soft tissue sarcoma,"Soft tissue sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that starts as a growth of cells in the body's soft tissues. The soft tissues connect, support and surround other body structures. Soft tissues include muscle, fat, blood vessels, nerves, tendons and linings of the joints.
Soft tissue sarcoma can happen anywhere in the body. It happens most often in the arms, legs and belly.
More than 50 types of soft tissue sarcoma exist. Some types are more likely to affect children. Others affect mostly adults. These cancers can be hard to diagnose because they may be mistaken for many other types of growths.
Soft tissue sarcoma treatment usually involves surgery. Other treatments might include radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Treatment depends on the size, type and location of the cancer and how quickly it grows.","A soft tissue sarcoma may not cause any symptoms at first. As the cancer grows, it may cause: | A noticeable lump or swelling. | Pain, if the growth presses on nerves or muscles.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/soft-tissue-sarcoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20377725

Scabies,"Scabies is an itchy skin rash caused by a tiny burrowing mite called Sarcoptes scabiei. Intense itching occurs in the area where the mite burrows. The need to scratch may be stronger at night.
Scabies is contagious and can spread quickly through close person-to-person contact in a family, child care group, school class, nursing home or prison. Because scabies spreads so easily, health care providers often recommend treating the entire family or any close contacts.
Scabies is easily treated. Medicated skin creams or pills kill the mites that cause scabies and their eggs. But itching may not stop for many weeks after treatment.","Scabies symptoms include: | Itching, often severe and usually worse at night | Thin, wavy tunnels made up of tiny blisters or bumps on the skin | Scabies is often found in the skin folds. But scabies can appear on many parts of the body. In adults and older children, scabies is most often found: | Between the fingers and toes | In the armpits | Around the waist | Along the insides of the wrists | On the inner elbows | On the soles of the feet | On the chest | Around the nipples | Around the belly button | Around the genitals | In the groin area | On the buttocks | In infants and young children, common sites of scabies usually include the: | Fingers | Face, scalp and neck | Palms of the hands | Soles of the feet | If you've had scabies before, symptoms may start within a few days of exposure. If you've never had scabies, it can take as long as six weeks for symptoms to start. You can still spread scabies even if you don't have any symptoms yet.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/scabies/symptoms-causes/syc-20377378
Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD),"Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is an emergency condition that occurs when a tear forms in a wall of a heart artery. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection also is calledSCAD.
SCADcan slow or block blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack, heart rhythm problems or sudden death.
SCADmost commonly affects women in their 40s and 50s, though it can occur at any age and can occur in men. People who haveSCADoften don't have risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes.
SCADcan cause sudden death if it isn't treated promptly. Get emergency medical help if you have heart attack symptoms — even if you think you aren't at risk of a heart attack.","Symptoms ofSCADcan include: | Chest pain or pressure. | Pain in the arms, shoulders, back or jaw. | Shortness of breath. | Unusual sweating. | Extreme tiredness. | Upset stomach. | A rapid heartbeat or fluttery feeling in the chest. | Feeling dizzy.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/symptoms-causes/syc-20353711
Burning mouth syndrome,"Burning mouth syndrome is the medical term for ongoing or recurring burning in the mouth without an obvious cause. You may feel this burning on your tongue, gums, lips, inside of your cheeks, roof of your mouth or large areas of your whole mouth. The feeling of burning can be severe, as if you injured your mouth with a very hot drink.
Burning mouth syndrome usually comes on suddenly, but it can develop slowly over time. Often the specific cause can't be found. Although that makes treatment more challenging, working closely with your health care team can help you reduce symptoms.","Symptoms of burning mouth syndrome may include: | A burning or scalding feeling that most commonly affects your tongue, but also may affect your lips, gums, roof of your mouth, throat or whole mouth. | A feeling of dry mouth with increased thirst. | Taste changes in your mouth, such as a bitter or metallic taste. | Loss of taste. | Tingling, stinging or numbness in your mouth. | The discomfort from burning mouth syndrome can have several different patterns. It may: | Happen every day, with little discomfort when waking up, but become worse as the day goes on. | Start as soon as you wake up and last all day. | Come and go. | Whatever pattern of mouth discomfort you have, burning mouth syndrome may last for months to years. In rare cases, symptoms may suddenly go away on their own or happen less often. Sometimes the burning feeling may be briefly relieved during eating or drinking. | Burning mouth syndrome usually doesn't cause any physical changes to your tongue or mouth that can be seen.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/burning-mouth-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20350911

Schizoaffective disorder,"Schizoaffective disorder is a mental health condition that is marked by a mix of schizophrenia symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, and mood disorder symptoms, such as depression, mania and a milder form of mania called hypomania. Hallucinations involve seeing things or hearing voices that others don't observe. Delusions involve believing things that are not real or not true.
The two types of schizoaffective disorder — both of which include some symptoms of schizophrenia — are:
Schizoaffective disorder may affect people differently.
Schizoaffective disorder changes how people think, feel and act. When it isn't treated, the condition can make it hard to function at work or school or in social settings. It also can cause loneliness. People with schizoaffective disorder may need help and support to live their daily lives. Treatment can help manage symptoms and make quality of life better.","Schizoaffective disorder symptoms may vary from person to person. People with the condition have psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions. They also can have symptoms of a mood disorder. This type of schizophrenia could be the bipolar type, which features bouts of mania and sometimes depression. Or it could be the depressive type, which features bouts of depression. | How schizoaffective disorder starts and how it affects people may vary. But defining features include a major bout of depressed or manic mood and at least a two-week period of psychotic symptoms when mood symptoms are not present. | Symptoms of schizoaffective disorder depend on the type — bipolar or depressive. Symptoms may include: | Delusions — having false, fixed beliefs, despite facts showing that they're not true. | Hallucinations, such as hearing voices or seeing things that others don't observe. | Disorganized thinking and speech. | Bizarre or unusual behavior. | Symptoms of depression, such as feeling empty, sad or worthless. | Periods of manic mood, with more energy and less need for sleep over several days, and behaviors that are out of character. | Having a hard time functioning at work or school or in social situations. | Problems managing personal care, such as not looking clean and not taking care in how one looks.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/schizoaffective-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20354504
Schizoid personality disorder,"Schizoid personality disorder is a condition where a person shows very little, if any, interest and ability to form relationships with other people. It's very hard for the person to express a full range of emotions.
If you have schizoid personality disorder, you may be seen as keeping to yourself or rejecting others. You may not be interested in or able to form close friendships or romantic relationships. Because you do not tend to show emotion, it may appear that you do not care about others or what's going on around you.
Schizoid personality disorder is less common than other personality disorders, but it's much more common than schizophrenia. The cause is not known. Some symptoms of schizoid personality disorder are similar to autism spectrum disorders, other personality disorders — especially avoidant personality disorder — and early symptoms of schizophrenia.
Talk therapy, also called psychotherapy, can help those who know they need to improve relationships with others. But it's common to feel unsure about change. Medicines are mainly used to treat mental health conditions that occur along with schizoid personality disorder, rather than the disorder itself.","If you have schizoid personality disorder, it's likely that you: | Want to be alone and do activities alone. | Do not want or enjoy close relationships. | Feel little if any desire for sexual relationships. | Take pleasure in few activities, if any. | Find it hard to express your emotions and react. | May lack humor or not be interested in others. Or you may be cold toward others. | May lack the drive that makes you want to reach goals. | Do not react to praise or criticism from others. | People may view you as odd or unusual. | Schizoid personality disorder most often begins when a person is a young adult. But some symptoms might be noticed during childhood. These symptoms may make it hard to do well in school, at work, in social situations or in other areas of life. But the person may do well if the job can be done by mostly working alone.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/schizoid-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20354414
Schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia is a serious mental health condition that affects how people think, feel and behave. It may result in a mix of hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking and behavior. Hallucinations involve seeing things or hearing voices that aren't observed by others. Delusions involve firm beliefs about things that are not true. People with schizophrenia can seem to lose touch with reality, which can make daily living very hard.
People with schizophrenia need lifelong treatment. This includes medicine, talk therapy and help in learning how to manage daily life activities.
Because many people with schizophrenia don't know they have a mental health condition and may not believe they need treatment, many research studies have examined the results of untreated psychosis. People who have psychosis that is not treated often have more-severe symptoms, more stays in a hospital, poorer thinking and processing skills and social outcomes, injuries, and even death. On the other hand, early treatment often helps control symptoms before serious complications arise, making the long-term outlook better.","Schizophrenia involves a range of problems in how people think, feel and behave. Symptoms may include: | Delusions.This is when people believe in things that aren't real or true. For example, people with schizophrenia could think that they're being harmed or harassed when they aren't. They could think that they're the target for certain gestures or comments when they aren't. They may think they're very famous or have great ability when that's not the case. Or they could feel that a major disaster is about to occur when that's not true. Most people with schizophrenia have delusions. | Hallucinations.These usually involve seeing or hearing things that other people don't observe. For people with schizophrenia, these things seem real. Hallucinations can occur with any of the senses, but hearing voices is most common. | Disorganized speech and thinking.Disorganized speech causes disorganized thinking. It can be hard for people with schizophrenia to talk with other people. The answers people with schizophrenia give to questions may not be related to what's being asked. Or questions may not be answered fully. Rarely, speech may include putting together unrelated words in a way that can't be understood. Sometimes this is called word salad. | Extremely disorganized or unusual motor behavior.This may show in several ways, from childlike silliness to being agitated for no reason. Behavior isn't focused on a goal, so it's hard to do tasks. People with schizophrenia may not want to follow instructions. They may move in ways that are not typical or not appropriate to the social setting. Or they may not move much or respond at all. | Negative symptoms.People with schizophrenia may not be able to function in the way they could before their illness started. For example, they may not bathe, make eye contact or show emotions. They may speak in a monotone voice and not be able to feel pleasure. Also, they may lose interest in everyday activities, socially withdraw and have a hard time planning ahead. | Symptoms can vary in type and how severe they are. At times, symptoms may get better or worse. Some symptoms may be present at all times. | People with schizophrenia usually are diagnosed in the late teen years to early 30s. In men, schizophrenia symptoms usually start in the late teens to early 20s. In women, symptoms usually begin in the late 20s to early 30s. There also is a group of people — usually women — who are diagnosed later in life. It isn't common for children to be diagnosed with schizophrenia.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/schizophrenia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354443
Childhood schizophrenia,"Childhood schizophrenia is an uncommon but severe mental disorder in which children and teenagers interpret reality abnormally. Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking (cognitive), behavior or emotions. It may result in some combination of hallucinations, delusions, and extremely disordered thinking and behavior that impairs your child's ability to function.
Childhood schizophrenia is essentially the same as schizophrenia in adults, but it starts early in life — generally in the teenage years — and has a profound impact on a child's behavior and development. With childhood schizophrenia, the early age of onset presents special challenges for diagnosis, treatment, education, and emotional and social development.
Schizophrenia is a chronic condition that requires lifelong treatment. Identifying and starting treatment for childhood schizophrenia as early as possible may significantly improve your child's long-term outcome.","Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking, behavior or emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. The effect can be disabling. | In most people with schizophrenia, symptoms generally start in the mid- to late 20s, though it can start later, up to the mid-30s. Schizophrenia is considered early onset when it starts before the age of 18. Onset of schizophrenia in children younger than age 13 is extremely rare. | Symptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with periods of worsening and remission of symptoms. Some symptoms may always be present. Schizophrenia can be difficult to recognize in the early phases.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/childhood-schizophrenia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354483
Schizotypal personality disorder,"People with schizotypal personality disorder are often described as odd or eccentric, and they usually have few, if any, close relationships. They generally don't know how relationships form or how their behavior affects others. They also tend to misinterpret others' motivations and behaviors and greatly distrust others.
These problems may lead to severe anxiety and a tendency to stay away from social situations. That's because people with schizotypal personality disorder tend to hold odd beliefs and may find it hard to respond correctly to social cues.
Schizotypal personality disorder usually is diagnosed in early adulthood, although some features of this condition may show up during childhood and the teen years. It's likely to be a lifelong condition. Treatments, such as medicines and therapy, can make symptoms better.","Schizotypal personality disorder usually includes five or more of these symptoms. The person may: | Be a loner and lack close friends and other relationships outside of the immediate family. | Have flat emotions or have emotional responses that are limited or not proper socially. | Have too much social anxiety, which is ongoing. | Incorrectly interpret events, such as feeling that something harmless or not offensive has a direct personal meaning. | Have strange or unusual thinking, beliefs or mannerisms. | Have suspicious or paranoid thoughts and constant doubts about the loyalty of others. | Believe in special powers, such as mental telepathy or superstitions. | Have unusual thoughts, such as sensing an absent person's presence, or having illusions. | Dress in odd ways, such as appearing messy or wearing oddly matched clothes. | Speak in an odd way, such as vague or unusual patterns of speaking, or ramble oddly while speaking. | Symptoms of schizotypal personality disorder, such as more interest in activities done alone or a high level of social anxiety, may be seen in the teen years. The child may not do well in school or appear socially out of step with peers. This may lead to teasing or bullying.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/schizotypal-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20353919
Schwannomatosis,"Schwannomatosis is a condition that results in slow-growing tumors on nerve tissue. The tumors can grow on nerves in the ears, brain, spine and eyes. They also can grow on peripheral nerves, which are nerves located outside of the brain and spinal cord. Schwannomatosis is rare. It's usually diagnosed in early adulthood.
There are three types of schwannomatosis. Each type is caused by an altered gene.
In NF2-related schwannomatosis (NF2), tumors grow in both ears and can cause hearing loss. The altered gene that causes this type is sometimes passed down from a parent. NF2-related schwannomatosis was previously known as neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2).
The other two types of schwannomatosis are SMARCB1-related schwannomatosis and LZTR1-related schwannomatosis. The altered genes that cause these types usually are not passed down through families.
The tumors caused by schwannomatosis usually are not cancerous. Symptoms can include headaches, hearing loss, trouble with balance and pain. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms.",Schwannomatosis symptoms depend on the type.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/schwannomatosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20567542
Spinal cord injury,"A spinal cord injury involves damage to any part of the spinal cord. It also can include damage to nerves at the end of the spinal cord, known as the cauda equina. The spinal cord sends and receives signals between the brain and the rest of the body. A spinal cord injury often causes permanent changes in strength, feeling and other body functions below the site of the injury.
People who have had a spinal cord injury also may experience mental, emotional and social side effects.
Many scientists are optimistic that advances in research will someday make repair of spinal cord injuries possible. Research studies are ongoing around the world. In the meantime, treatments and rehabilitation allow many people with spinal cord injuries to lead productive, independent lives.","The ability to control your arms or legs after a spinal cord injury depends on two factors. One factor is where the injury occurred on the spinal cord. The other factor is how bad the injury is. | The lowest part of the spinal cord not damaged after an injury is known as the neurological level of the injury. ""The completeness"" of the injury refers to how much feeling, known as sensation, is lost. Completeness is classified as: | Complete.If all feeling and all ability to control movement are lost below the spinal cord injury, the injury is called complete. | Incomplete.If some feeling and control of movement remain below the affected area, the injury is called incomplete. There are varying degrees of incomplete injury. | Loss of feeling and control of movement is known as paralysis. Paralysis from a spinal cord injury can be referred to as: | Tetraplegia, also known as quadriplegia.This means that your arms, hands, trunk, legs and pelvic organs are all affected by your spinal cord injury. | Paraplegia.This paralysis affects all or part of the trunk, legs and pelvic organs but not the arms. | Your healthcare team performs a series of tests to determine the neurological level and completeness of your injury. | Spinal cord injuries can cause the following symptoms: | Loss of movement. | Loss of or a change in sensation. This includes a change in the ability to feel heat, cold and touch. | Loss of bowel or bladder control. | Exaggerated reflex activities or spasms. | Changes in sexual function, sexual sensitivity and fertility. | Pain or an intense stinging sensation caused by damage to the nerve fibers in the spinal cord. | Trouble breathing, coughing or clearing secretions from the lungs.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/spinal-cord-injury/symptoms-causes/syc-20377890
Sciatica,"Sciatica refers to pain that travels along the path of the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve travels from the buttocks and down each leg.
Sciatica most often happens when a herniated disk or an overgrowth of bone puts pressure on the lumbar spine nerve roots. This happens ""upstream"" from the sciatic nerve. This causes inflammation, pain and often some numbness in the affected leg.
Although the pain associated with sciatica can be serious, those cases that are caused by a herniated disk can clear up with treatment in a few weeks to months. People who have severe sciatica and serious leg weakness or bowel or bladder changes might need surgery.","Sciatica pain can be almost anywhere along the nerve pathway. It's especially likely to follow a path from the low back to the buttock and the back of a thigh and calf. | The pain can vary from a mild ache to a sharp, burning pain. Sometimes it feels like a jolt or electric shock. It can be worse when coughing or sneezing or sitting a long time. Usually, sciatica affects only one side of the body. | Some people also have numbness, tingling, or muscle weakness in the leg or foot. One part of the leg can be in pain, while another part can feel numb.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sciatica/symptoms-causes/syc-20377435
Scleroderma,"Scleroderma (sklair-oh-DUR-muh), also known as systemic sclerosis, is a group of rare diseases that involve the hardening and tightening of the skin. Scleroderma also may cause problems in the blood vessels, internal organs and digestive tract.
Scleroderma is often categorized as limited or diffuse, which refers only to the degree of skin involvement. Both types can involve any of the other vascular or organ symptoms that are part of the disease. Localized scleroderma, also known as morphea, affects only the skin.
While there is no cure for scleroderma, treatments can ease symptoms, slow progression and improve quality of life.","Scleroderma symptoms vary from person to person, depending on which parts of the body are affected.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/scleroderma/symptoms-causes/syc-20351952
Primary sclerosing cholangitis,"Primary sclerosing (skluh-ROHS-ing) cholangitis (koh-lan-JIE-tis) is a disease of the bile ducts. Bile ducts carry the digestive liquid bile from your liver to your small intestine. In primary sclerosing cholangitis, inflammation causes scars within the bile ducts. These scars make the ducts hard and narrow and gradually cause serious liver damage. A majority of people with primary sclerosing cholangitis also have inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.
In most people with primary sclerosing cholangitis, the disease progresses slowly. It can eventually lead to liver failure, repeated infections, and tumors of the bile duct or liver. A liver transplant is the only known cure for advanced primary sclerosing cholangitis, but the disease may recur in the transplanted liver in a small number of patients.
Care for primary sclerosing cholangitis focuses on monitoring liver function, managing symptoms and, when possible, doing procedures that temporarily open blocked bile ducts.",Primary sclerosing cholangitis is often diagnosed before symptoms appear when a routine blood test or an X-ray taken for an unrelated condition shows liver abnormalities. | Early signs and symptoms often include: | Fatigue | Itching | Yellow eyes and skin (jaundice) | Abdominal pain | Many people diagnosed with primary sclerosing cholangitis before they have symptoms continue to feel generally well for several years. But there's no reliable way to predict how quickly or slowly the disease will progress for any individual. | Signs and symptoms that may appear as the disease progresses include: | Fever | Chills | Night sweats | Enlarged liver | Enlarged spleen | Weight loss,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355797
Sclerosing mesenteritis,"Sclerosing mesenteritis is a condition in which tissue that holds the small intestines in place, called the mesentery, becomes inflamed and forms scar tissue. The condition also is called mesenteric panniculitis. Sclerosing mesenteritis is rare, and it's not clear what causes it.
Sclerosing mesenteritis can cause belly pain, vomiting, bloating, diarrhea and fever. But some people experience no symptoms and may never need treatment.
In rare cases, scar tissue formed by sclerosing mesenteritis can block food from moving through the digestive tract. In this case, you may need surgery.","Symptoms of sclerosing mesenteritis include pain in the belly, vomiting, bloating, diarrhea and fever. Sometimes people don't have any symptoms.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sclerosing-mesenteritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355087
Multiple sclerosis,"Multiple sclerosis is a disease that causes breakdown of the protective covering of nerves. Multiple sclerosis can cause numbness, weakness, trouble walking, vision changes and other symptoms. It's also known as MS.
In MS, the immune system attacks the protective sheath that covers nerve fibers, known as myelin. This interrupts communication between the brain and the rest of the body. Eventually, the disease can cause permanent damage of the nerve fibers.
Symptoms of MS depend on the person, the location of damage in the nervous system and how bad the damage is to the nerve fibers. Some people lose the ability to walk on their own or move at all. Others may have long periods between attacks without any new symptoms, called remission. The course of the disease varies depending on the type of MS.
There's no cure for multiple sclerosis. However, there are treatments to help speed the recovery from attacks, modify the course of the disease and manage symptoms.","Multiple sclerosis symptoms vary depending on the person. Symptoms may change over the course of the disease depending on which nerve fibers are affected. | Common symptoms include: | Numbness or tingling. | Electric-shock sensations that happen with certain neck movements, especially bending the neck forward. This sensation is called Lhermitte sign. | Lack of coordination. | Trouble with walking or not being able to walk at all. | Weakness. | Partial or complete loss of vision, usually in one eye at a time. Vision loss often happens with pain during eye movement. | Double vision. | Blurry vision. | Dizziness and a false sense that you or your surroundings are moving, known as vertigo. | Trouble with sexual, bowel and bladder function. | Fatigue. | Slurred speech. | Troubles with memory, thinking and understanding information. | Mood changes. | Small increases in body temperature can temporarily worsen symptoms of MS. These aren't considered true disease relapses but pseudorelapses.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350269
Scoliosis,"Scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine that most often is diagnosed in adolescents. While scoliosis can occur in people with conditions such as cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy, the cause of most childhood scoliosis is not known.
Most cases of scoliosis are mild, but some curves worsen as children grow. Severe scoliosis can be disabling. An especially serious spinal curve can reduce the amount of space within the chest, making it difficult for the lungs to function properly.
Children who have mild scoliosis are monitored closely, usually with X-rays, to see if the curve is getting worse. In many cases, no treatment is necessary. Some children may need to wear a brace to stop the curve from worsening. Others may need surgery to straighten more serious curves.","Symptoms of scoliosis may include: | Uneven shoulders. | One shoulder blade that appears more prominent than the other. | Uneven waist. | One hip higher than the other. | One side of the rib cage jutting forward. | A prominence on one side of the back when bending forward. | With most scoliosis cases, the spine will rotate or twist in addition to curving side to side. This causes the ribs or muscles on one side of the body to stick out farther than those on the other side.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/scoliosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350716
Scorpion sting,"Scorpion stings are painful but rarely life-threatening. Healthy adults usually don't need treatment for scorpion stings. Young children and older adults are most at risk of serious complications.
Scorpions are arthropods — a relative of insects, spiders and crustaceans. Bark scorpions — the only scorpion species in the U.S. with venom strong enough to cause serious symptoms — are generally about 1.6 to 3 inches (4 to 8 cm) long, including a segmented tail with a stinger that can deliver venom. They're found mainly in the desert Southwest. Worldwide, of more than 2,000 species of scorpions, about 100 produce venom serious enough to be fatal.
Scorpions have eight legs and a pair of lobster-like pinchers and a tail that curves up. They're generally more active at night. They usually won't sting unless provoked or attacked. Most stings occur when they're accidentally grabbed or stepped on or brushed against the body.","Symptoms at the site of a scorpion sting may include: | Pain, which can be intense. | Numbness and tingling. | Slight swelling. | Warmth. | Symptoms from venom that affect the whole body — usually in children who are stung — include: | A hard time breathing. | Muscle twitching or thrashing. | Unusual head, neck and eye movements. | Drooling. | Sweating. | Slurred speech. | Nausea and vomiting. | High blood pressure (hypertension). | Fast heart rate (tachycardia). | Being restless or excitable, or crying in children that can't be comforted. | As with other stinging insects, such as bees and wasps, it is possible for people who have been stung by scorpions before to have allergic reactions when stung later. Reactions to these later stings are sometimes serious enough to cause a life-threatening condition called anaphylaxis. Symptoms in these cases are like those of anaphylaxis caused by bee stings, including hives, trouble breathing, and nausea and vomiting.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/scorpion-stings/symptoms-causes/syc-20353859
Scrotal masses,"Scrotal masses are lumps or swelling in the scrotum, the bag of skin that holds the testicles.
Scrotal masses might be:
It's key to get a scrotal mass checked by a health care professional, even if you don't have pain or other symptoms. Some masses could be cancer. Or they could be caused by another medical condition that affects the health of the testicles and how well they work.
Each month, check your scrotum for any changes. Also get the area checked during regular health checkups. This can help you spot masses early, when many treatments work better.","Symptoms of scrotal masses vary. Some cause pain and others don't. It depends on the cause. Symptoms of a scrotal mass might include: | An unusual lump. | Sudden pain. | Dull aching or a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum. | Pain that spreads all over the groin, stomach area or lower back. | A tender, swollen or hardened testicle or epididymis (ep-ih-DID-uh-miss). The epididymis is the soft, comma-shaped tube above and behind the testicle that stores and transports sperm. | Swelling in the scrotum. | A change in color of the skin of the scrotum. | Upset stomach or vomiting. | If an infection causes a scrotal mass, symptoms also might include: | Fever. | Needing to pee often. | Pus or blood in the urine.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/scrotal-masses/symptoms-causes/syc-20352604
Hay fever,"Hay fever, also called allergic rhinitis, causes cold-like symptoms. These may include a runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, sneezing and sinus pressure. But unlike a cold, hay fever isn't caused by a virus. Hay fever is caused by an allergic response to a harmless outdoor or indoor substance the body identifies as harmful (allergen).
Common allergens that can trigger hay fever symptoms include pollen and dust mites. Tiny flecks of skin shed by cats, dogs, and other animals with fur or feathers (pet dander) also can be allergens.
Besides making you miserable, hay fever can affect how well you perform at work or school and can generally interfere with your life. But you don't have to put up with annoying symptoms. You can learn to avoid triggers and find the right treatment.","Hay fever symptoms can include: | Runny nose and nasal stuffiness, called congestion. | Watery, itchy, red eyes. | Sneezing. | Cough. | Itchy nose, roof of mouth or throat. | Mucus that runs down the back of the throat, called postnasal drip. | Swollen, bruised-appearing skin under the eyes, known as allergic shiners. | Extreme tiredness and fatigue, often due to poor sleep.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hay-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20373039
Sebaceous carcinoma,"Sebaceous carcinoma is a rare type of cancer that begins in an oil gland in the skin. Sebaceous carcinoma most often affects the eyelids.
Sebaceous carcinoma may begin as a painless lump or thickening of skin on the eyelid. On other parts of the body, it might cause a bump on the skin that may bleed or have a scab.
Sebaceous carcinoma treatment often involves surgery to remove the cancer. Sebaceous carcinoma can grow quickly and sometimes spreads to other parts of the body.","Symptoms of sebaceous carcinoma may vary based on where it starts. This cancer happens most often on the eyelid. | Symptoms of sebaceous carcinoma on the eyelid include: | A small, painless lump on the upper eyelid. | A lump that may look pink, red-brown or yellow. | Eyelid skin that becomes thicker. | Swelling and irritation on the eyelid. | When sebaceous carcinoma happens on other parts of the body it's called extraocular sebaceous carcinoma. Symptoms of extraocular sebaceous carcinoma include: | A lump on the skin. | A lump that may look yellow, tan, dark brown or copper-colored depending on your skin color. | A lump that forms on the head, neck, trunk, arm or leg.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sebaceous-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20577038
Epidermoid cysts,"Epidermoid (ep-ih-DUR-moid) cysts are harmless small bumps beneath the skin. They are most common on the face, neck and trunk.
Epidermoid cysts are slow growing and often painless, so they rarely cause problems or need treatment. You might choose to have a cyst removed if it bothers you, breaks open, or is painful or infected.","Epidermoid cyst signs and symptoms include: | A small, round bump under the skin, often on the face, neck or trunk | A tiny blackhead plugging the central opening of the cyst | A thick, smelly, cheesy substance that leaks from the cyst | An inflamed or infected bump",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epidermoid-cysts/symptoms-causes/syc-20352701
Seborrheic dermatitis,"Seborrheic (seb-o-REE-ik) dermatitis is a common skin condition that mainly affects your scalp. It causes scaly patches, inflamed skin and stubborn dandruff. It usually affects oily areas of the body, such as the face, sides of the nose, eyebrows, ears, eyelids and chest. This condition can be irritating but it's not contagious, and it doesn't cause permanent hair loss.
Seborrheic dermatitis may go away without treatment. Or you may need to use medicated shampoo or other products long term to clear up symptoms and prevent flare-ups.
Seborrheic dermatitis is also called dandruff, seborrheic eczema and seborrheic psoriasis. When it occurs in infants, it's called cradle cap.","Seborrheic dermatitis signs and symptoms may include: | Flaking skin (dandruff) on your scalp, hair, eyebrows, beard or mustache | Patches of greasy skin covered with flaky white or yellow scales or crust on the scalp, face, sides of the nose, eyebrows, ears, eyelids, chest, armpits, groin area or under the breasts | Rash that may look darker or lighter in people with brown or Black skin and redder in those with white skin | Ring-shaped (annular) rash, for a type called petaloid seborrheic dermatitis | Itchiness (pruritus) | The signs and symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis tend to flare with stress, fatigue or a change of season.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seborrheic-dermatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352710

Brain metastases,"Brain metastases happen when cancer cells spread from their original site to the brain. Any cancer can spread to the brain. But the most common types that spread are lung, breast, colon, kidney and melanoma.
Brain metastases may form one or more tumors in the brain. As they grow, they put pressure on surrounding brain tissue. This can cause symptoms such as headache, personality changes, confusion, seizures, vision changes, trouble speaking, numbness, weakness or loss of balance.
Treatment for people whose cancer has spread to the brain may include surgery, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy or chemotherapy. Other treatments might be used to decrease pain and symptoms caused by the cancer.","Symptoms caused by brain metastases can vary. They depend on location, size and how fast they're growing. | Symptoms of brain metastases include: | Headache, sometimes with vomiting or nausea. | Mental changes, such as increasing memory problems. | Seizures. | Weakness or numbness on one side of the body. | Vision changes. | Difficulty speaking or understanding language. | Loss of balance.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brain-metastases/symptoms-causes/syc-20350136

Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS),"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complicated disorder.
It causes extreme fatigue that lasts for at least six months. Symptoms worsen with physical or mental activity but don't fully improve with rest.
The cause ofME/CFSis unknown, although there are many theories. Experts believe it might be triggered by a combination of factors.
There's no single test to confirm a diagnosis. You may need a variety of medical tests to rule out other health problems that have similar symptoms. Treatment for the condition focuses on easing symptoms.","Symptoms ofME/CFScan vary from person to person, and the severity of symptoms can fluctuate from day to day. In addition to fatigue, symptoms may include: | Extreme exhaustion after physical or mental exercise. | Problems with memory or thinking skills. | Dizziness that worsens with moving from lying down or sitting to standing. | Muscle or joint pain. | Unrefreshing sleep. | Some people with this condition have headaches, sore throats, and tender lymph nodes in the neck or armpits.

Epilepsy,"Epilepsy — also known as a seizure disorder — is a brain condition that causes recurring seizures. There are many types of epilepsy. In some people, the cause can be identified. In others, the cause is not known.
Epilepsy is common. It's estimated that 1.2% of people in the United States have active epilepsy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Epilepsy affects people of all genders, races, ethnic backgrounds and ages.
Seizure symptoms can vary widely. Some people may lose awareness during a seizure while others don't. Some people stare blankly for a few seconds during a seizure. Others may repeatedly twitch their arms or legs, movements known as convulsions.
Having a single seizure doesn't mean you have epilepsy. Epilepsy is diagnosed if you've had at least two unprovoked seizures at least 24 hours apart. Unprovoked seizures don't have a clear cause.
Treatment with medicines or sometimes surgery can control seizures for most people with epilepsy. Some people require lifelong treatment. For others, seizures go away. Some children with epilepsy may outgrow the condition with age.","Seizure symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. Because epilepsy is caused by certain activity in the brain, seizures can affect any brain process. Seizure symptoms may include: | Temporary confusion. | A staring spell. | Stiff muscles. | Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs. | Loss of consciousness. | Psychological symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu. | Sometimes people with epilepsy may have changes in their behavior. They also may have symptoms of psychosis. | Most people with epilepsy tend to have the same type of seizure each time. Symptoms are usually similar from episode to episode.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epilepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350093
Absence seizure,"Absence seizures involve brief, sudden lapses of consciousness. They're more common in children than in adults.
A person having an absence seizure may stare blankly into space for a few seconds. Then the person typically returns quickly to being alert. This type of seizure usually doesn't lead to physical injury. But injury can happen if someone is driving a car or riding a bike when the seizure happens.
Absence seizures usually can be managed with antiseizure medicines. Some children who have them also develop other seizures, such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures or myoclonic seizures. Many children outgrow absence seizures in their teens.","A simple absence seizure causes a vacant stare, which may be mistaken for a brief lapse in attention. The seizure lasts about 10 seconds, though it may last as long as 30 seconds. There's no confusion, headache or drowsiness after the seizure. | Symptoms of absence seizures include: | A sudden stop in activity without falling. | Lip smacking. | Eyelid flutters. | Chewing motions. | Finger rubbing. | Small movements of both hands. | Afterward, there's usually no memory of the incident. But if the seizure is longer, the person may be aware of missed time. Some people have many episodes daily. When it happens, it can interfere with school or daily activities. | A child may have absence seizures for some time before an adult notices them. This is because the seizures are so brief. A decline in a child's learning ability may be the first sign of the seizure disorder. Teachers may say the child has trouble paying attention or that a child is often daydreaming.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/petit-mal-seizure/symptoms-causes/syc-20359683
Febrile seizure,,,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/febrile-seizure/symptoms-causes/syc-20372522
Tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure,"A tonic-clonic seizure, previously known as a grand mal seizure, causes a loss of consciousness and violent muscle contractions. It's the type of seizure most people picture when they think about seizures.
During a seizure, there's a burst of electrical activity in the brain that causes changes in behavior and movements. Seizures can be focal, meaning the burst of electrical activity happens in one area of the brain. Or seizures can be generalized, in which they result in electrical activity in all areas of the brain. Tonic-clonic seizures may begin as focal seizures in a small area of the brain and spread to become generalized seizures that involve the whole brain.
Focal and generalized seizures have different symptoms. People who have generalized seizures usually lose consciousness. But people who have focal seizures may or may not lose consciousness. In tonic-clonic seizures, the muscles become stiff, causing the person to fall. Then the muscles alternately flex and relax.
Usually, a tonic-clonic seizure is caused by epilepsy. But sometimes this type of seizure can be triggered by other health problems, such as a high fever or damage to the brain.
Some people who have a tonic-clonic seizure don’t have another one and don't need treatment. But someone who has recurrent seizures may need treatment with daily anti-seizure medicines to control and prevent future tonic-clonic seizures. Surgery and dietary changes also may be options to manage your seizures.","Tonic-clonic seizures have two stages: | Tonic phase.Often, someone in the tonic phase will make a sound, such as a groan or yell. The muscles suddenly get stiff and cause the person to fall down. Loss of consciousness occurs. This phase tends to last about 10 to 20 seconds. | Clonic phase.The muscles go into rhythmic contractions. The arms and legs often jerk. They alternately flex and relax. Convulsions usually last 1 to 2 minutes or less. | The following symptoms occur in some but not all people with tonic-clonic seizures: | Loss of bowel and bladder function.This may happen during or following a seizure. | Not responding after convulsions.The person may not become conscious for several minutes after convulsions have ended. | Confusion.The person often is disoriented after a tonic-clonic seizure. This is referred to as postictal confusion. | Fatigue.Sleepiness is common after a tonic-clonic seizure. | Bad headache.Headaches may occur after a tonic-clonic seizure.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/grand-mal-seizure/symptoms-causes/syc-20363458
Temporal lobe seizure,"Temporal lobe seizures begin in the temporal lobes of the brain. These areas process emotions and are important for short-term memory. Symptoms of a temporal lobe seizure often affect these functions . Some people have odd feelings during the seizure, such as joy, deja vu or fear.
Temporal lobe seizures are sometimes called focal seizures with impaired awareness. Some people are aware of what's going on during the seizure. People who have more-intense seizures might look awake but won't respond to what's around them. Their lips and hands may make motions over and over.
The cause of temporal lobe seizures often isn't known. But it may stem from a scar in the temporal lobe. Temporal lobe seizures are treated with medicine. Some people who don't respond to medicine may have surgery.","An odd feeling called an aura may happen before a temporal lobe seizure. An aura acts as a warning. Not everyone who has temporal lobe seizures has auras. And not everyone who has auras remembers them. | The aura is the first part of a focal seizure before a loss of consciousness. | Examples of auras include: | A sudden sense of fear or joy. | A feeling that what's happening has happened before, known as deja vu. | A sudden or strange odor or taste. | A rising feeling in the belly that feels like being on a roller coaster | Sometimes temporal lobe seizures keep people from responding to others. This type of temporal lobe seizure most often lasts 30 seconds to 2 minutes. | Symptoms of a temporal lobe seizure include: | Not being aware of the people and things around you. | Staring. | Lip smacking. | Swallowing or chewing over and over. | Finger movements, such as picking motions. | After a temporal lobe seizure, you may: | Be confused and have trouble speaking for a time. | Be unable to recall what happened during the seizure. | Be unaware of having had a seizure. | Be very sleepy. | Sometimes, what starts as a temporal lobe seizure becomes a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. This type of seizure causes shaking, known as convulsions, and loss of consciousness. It also is called a grand mal seizure.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/temporal-lobe-seizure/symptoms-causes/syc-20378214
Seizures,"A seizure is a sudden burst of electrical activity in the brain. It can cause changes in behavior, movements, feelings and levels of consciousness. Epilepsy is defined as having two or more seizures at least 24 hours apart that don't have a known cause. But epilepsy doesn't cause all seizures.
There are many types of seizures. They have a range of symptoms and vary in how much they affect your daily life. Seizure types also vary by where they begin in the brain and how far they spread. Most seizures last from 30 seconds to two minutes. A seizure that lasts longer than five minutes is a medical emergency.
Seizures can happen after a stroke or a head injury. An infection such as meningitis or another illness also may be the cause. But often the cause is not known.
Medicine can manage most seizures, but they can have side effects. Work with your healthcare professional to balance seizure management and medicine side effects.","Symptoms vary based on the type of seizure. They also can range from mild to serious. Seizure symptoms may include: | Short-lived confusion. | A staring spell. | Jerking movements of the arms and legs that can't be stopped. | Loss of consciousness or awareness. | Changes in thinking or emotions. These may include fear, anxiety or a feeling of already having lived the moment, called deja vu. | Most seizures fall into one of two classes called focal or generalized. The classes are based on how and where the brain activity causing the seizure began. If health professionals don't know how the seizures began, they may say the seizures are of unknown onset.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seizure/symptoms-causes/syc-20365711
Selective IgA deficiency,"Selective IgA deficiency is the lack of a disease-fighting antibody in the immune system called immunoglobulin A (IgA). People with this condition usually have typical levels of other immunoglobulins (im-u-no-GLOB-u-lins).
An immunoglobulin is an antibody produced by immune system cells to fight bacteria, parasites and other agents that cause illness. IgA antibodies circulate in the blood and are found in tears, saliva, breast milk, and fluids released from the lining of the airways, lungs and digestive system.
Most people with selective IgA deficiency have no symptoms. But some people who have selective IgA deficiency have frequent illness of the airways, lungs and digestive system.
Selective IgA deficiency may increase the risk of other conditions related to the immune system, such as allergies, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases and others.
There is no treatment specifically for selective IgA deficiency. Treatments focus on addressing the frequent, repeat or long-lasting conditions that develop with this immune system disorder.","Most people with selective IgA deficiency have no symptoms. Some people have illnesses more often than is typical. They also may have a particular illness that returns often. Having frequent illnesses doesn't necessarily mean a person has selective IgA deficiency. | People with selective IgA deficiency may have frequent or repeat episodes of the following: | Ear infections, particularly in young children. | Colds. | Sinus infections. | Lung illnesses, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. | Giardiasis, a parasitic illness of the digestive system that causes diarrhea. | Children with frequent illnesses may not eat well or may not gain weight typical for their age.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/selective-iga-deficiency/symptoms-causes/syc-20362236
Self-injury/cutting,"Nonsuicidal self-injury, often simply called self-injury, is the act of harming your own body on purpose, such as by cutting or burning yourself. It's usually not meant as a suicide attempt. This type of self-injury is a harmful way to cope with emotional pain, sadness, anger and stress.
While self-injury may bring a brief sense of calm and a release of physical and emotional tension, it's usually followed by guilt and shame and the return of painful emotions. Life-threatening injuries are usually not intended, but it's possible that more-serious and even fatal self-harm could happen.
Getting the proper treatment can help you learn healthier ways to cope.","Symptoms of self-injury may include: | Scars, often in patterns. | Fresh cuts, scratches, bruises, bite marks or other wounds. | Excessive rubbing of an area to create a burn. | Keeping sharp objects or other items used for self-injury on hand. | Wearing long sleeves or long pants to hide self-injury, even in hot weather. | Frequent reports of accidental injury. | Difficulties in relationships with others. | Behaviors and emotions that change quickly and are impulsive, intense and unexpected. | Talk of helplessness, hopelessness or worthlessness.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/self-injury/symptoms-causes/syc-20350950
Separation anxiety disorder,"Separation anxiety is a typical phase for many infants and toddlers. Young children often have a period where they get anxious or distressed when they have to separate from their parent or main caregivers. Examples of this can be tears at daycare drop-off or getting fussy when a new person holds them. This usually starts to improve by about 2 to 3 years of age.
In some children, intense and ongoing separation anxiety is a sign of a more serious condition known as separation anxiety disorder. Separation anxiety disorder can be identified as early as preschool age.
Your child may have separation anxiety disorder if separation anxiety seems more intense than other kids of the same age or lasts a longer time, interferes with school or other daily activities, or includes panic attacks or other problem behaviors. Most often, separation anxiety relates to the child's anxiety about being away from parents or guardians, but it could relate to another close caregiver.
Less often, separation anxiety disorder can occur in teenagers and adults. This can cause major problems leaving home or going to work.
Treatment can lessen separation anxiety disorder symptoms. Treatment may include specific types of therapy, sometimes along with medicine.","Separation anxiety disorder is diagnosed when symptoms are much more than expected for someone's developmental age and cause major distress or problems doing daily activities. Symptoms may include: | Repeated and intense distress when thinking about separation or when away from home or loved ones. This may include being clingy or having tantrums about separation that last longer or are more severe than other kids of the same age. | Constant, intense worry about losing a parent or other loved one to an illness, death, or a disaster or harm coming to them. | Constant worry that something bad will happen, such as being lost or kidnapped, causing separation from parents or other loved ones. | Not wanting to or refusing to be away from home because of fear of separation. | Not wanting to be home alone or somewhere without a parent or other loved one close by, if the child has reached an age where being alone might be expected. | Not wanting to or refusing to sleep away from home or to go to sleep without a parent or other loved one nearby, if the child has reached an age where these activities might be expected. | Repeated nightmares about separation. | Repeated complaints of headaches, stomachaches, or other symptoms during or before separation from a parent or other loved one. | Separation anxiety disorder may occur along with panic attacks. Panic attacks are repeated bouts of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/separation-anxiety-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20377455

Atrial septal defect (ASD),"An atrial septal defect (ASD) is a heart condition that you're born with. That means it's a congenital heart defect. People with anASDhave a hole between the upper heart chambers. The hole increases the amount of blood going through the lungs.
Small atrial septal defects might be found by chance and never cause a concern. Others might close during infancy or early childhood.
A large, long-term atrial septal defect can damage the heart and lungs. Surgery may be needed to repair an atrial septal defect and to prevent complications.","A baby born with an atrial septal defect (ASD) may not have symptoms. Symptoms may begin in adulthood. | Atrial septal defect symptoms may include: | Shortness of breath, especially when exercising. | Tiredness, especially with activity. | Swelling of the legs, feet or belly area. | Irregular heartbeats, also called arrhythmias. | Skipped heartbeats or feelings of a quick, pounding or fluttering heartbeat, called palpitations.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-septal-defect/symptoms-causes/syc-20369715

Coma,"Coma is a state of prolonged loss of consciousness. It can have a variety of causes, including traumatic head injury, stroke, brain tumor, or drug or alcohol intoxication. A coma may even be caused by an underlying illness, such as diabetes or an infection.
Coma is a medical emergency. Quick action is needed to preserve life and brain function. Healthcare professionals typically order a series of blood tests and a brain scan to try to learn what's causing the coma so that proper treatment can begin.
A coma doesn't usually last longer than several weeks. People who are unconscious for a longer time might transition to a lasting vegetative state, known as a persistent vegetative state, or brain death.","The symptoms of a coma commonly include: | Closed eyes. | Depressed brainstem reflexes, such as pupils not responding to light. | No responses of limbs except for reflex movements. | No response to painful stimuli except for reflex movements. | Irregular breathing.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coma/symptoms-causes/syc-20371099

Female sexual dysfunction,"Female sexual dysfunction is a medical term for ongoing sexual problems that upset you or your partner. Problems may involve sexual response, desire, orgasm or pain during sex.
Many people have sexual problems at some point. Some have them throughout their lives. Female sexual dysfunction can happen at any stage of life. It can happen only sometimes or all the time during sex.
Sexual response is complex. It involves how your body works, your feelings, things that happen in your life, your beliefs, your lifestyle and how you relate to your partner. A problem in any one of these areas can affect sexual desire, arousal or satisfaction. Treatment often involves more than one approach.","Symptoms vary depending on the type of sexual dysfunction. Symptoms may include: | Low sexual desire.This most common of female sexual dysfunctions involves a lack of interest in sex and not wanting to have sex. | Sexual arousal disorder.Even if you want sex, sometimes it may be hard to get or stay aroused during sex. | Orgasmic disorder.You have ongoing trouble having an orgasm even with enough sexual arousal. | Sexual pain disorder.You have pain when having sex.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/female-sexual-dysfunction/symptoms-causes/syc-20372549
Compulsive sexual behavior,"Compulsive sexual behavior is sometimes called hypersexuality or sexual addiction. It's an intense focus on sexual fantasies, urges or behaviors that can't be controlled. This causes distress and problems for your health, job, relationships or other parts of your life.
Compulsive sexual behavior may involve different kinds of commonly enjoyable sexual experiences. Examples include masturbation, sexual arousal by using a computer to communicate, multiple sexual partners, use of pornography or paying for sex. But when these sexual behaviors become a major, constant focus in your life, are difficult to control, cause problems in your life, or are harmful to you or others, that's likely compulsive sexual behavior.
No matter what it's called or the exact nature of the behavior, untreated compulsive sexual behavior can damage your self-esteem, relationships, career, health and other people. But with treatment and self-help, you can learn to manage compulsive sexual behavior.","Some signs that you may have compulsive sexual behavior include: | You have repeated and intense sexual fantasies, urges, and behaviors that take up a lot of your time and feel as if they're beyond your control. | You feel driven or have frequent urges to do certain sexual behaviors, feel a release of the tension afterward, but also feel guilt or deep regret. | You've tried without success to reduce or control your sexual fantasies, urges or behavior. | You use compulsive sexual behavior as an escape from other problems, such as loneliness, depression, anxiety or stress. | You continue to engage in sexual behaviors in spite of them causing serious problems.

Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs),"Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are caused by sexually transmitted infections (STIs). They are spread mainly by sexual contact.STIsare caused by bacteria, viruses or parasites. A sexually transmitted infection may pass from person to person in blood, semen, or vaginal and other bodily fluids.
Sometimes sexually transmitted infections are spread in ways other than sexual contact. For example,STIscan spread to infants during pregnancy or childbirth.STIsalso can spread through blood transfusions or shared needles.
STIsdon't always cause symptoms. A person can get sexually transmitted infections from another person who seems healthy and may not even know they have an infection.","STDscan have a range of symptoms, including no symptoms. That's why sexually transmitted infections may go unnoticed until a person has complications or a partner is diagnosed. | STIsymptoms might include: | Sores or bumps on the genitals or in the oral or rectal area. | Painful or burning urination. | Discharge from the penis. | Unusual or odorous vaginal discharge. | Unusual vaginal bleeding. | Pain during sex. | Sore, swollen lymph nodes, particularly in the groin but sometimes more widespread. | Lower abdominal pain. | Fever. | Rash over the trunk, hands or feet. | Sexually transmitted infection symptoms may appear a few days after exposure.

Shaken baby syndrome,"Shaken baby syndrome is a serious brain injury that results from forcefully shaking an infant or a toddler. It also is known as abusive head trauma, shaken impact syndrome, inflicted head injury or whiplash shaken infant syndrome.
Shaken baby syndrome can damage or destroy a child's brain cells. This form of child abuse can cause permanent brain damage or death.
Shaken baby syndrome is preventable. Help is available for parents who are at risk of harming a child. Parents also can teach other caregivers about the dangers of shaken baby syndrome.","Symptoms of shaken baby syndrome may include: | Extreme fussiness or irritability. | Difficulty staying awake. | Breathing problems. | Poor eating. | Vomiting. | Pale or discolored skin. | Seizures. | Paralysis. | Coma. | While sometimes a child may have bruising on the face, you may not see signs of physical injury to the child's outer body. Injuries that might not be seen immediately include: | Bleeding in the brain and eyes. | Spinal cord damage. | Fractures of the ribs, skull, legs and other bones. | Children with shaken baby syndrome often show symptoms of prior child abuse. | In mild cases of shaken baby syndrome, children may appear OK after being shaken.

Shellfish allergy,"Shellfish allergy is an atypical response by the body's immune system to proteins in certain marine animals. Marine animals in the shellfish category include crustaceans and mollusks. Examples are shrimp, crabs, lobster, squid, oysters, scallops and snails.
Shellfish is a common food allergy. Some people with shellfish allergy react to all shellfish, while others react to only certain kinds. Reactions range from mild symptoms — such as hives or a stuffy nose — to severe and even life-threatening.
If you think you have shellfish allergy, talk to your health care provider. Tests can help confirm the allergy so you can take steps to avoid future reactions.","Shellfish allergy symptoms generally start within minutes to an hour after eating or having contact with shellfish. They may include: | Hives | Itchy, irritated skin | Nasal stuffiness (congestion) | Swelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat, or other parts of the body | Wheezing or trouble breathing | Coughing and choking or a tight feeling in the throat | Belly (abdominal) pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting | Dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/shellfish-allergy/symptoms-causes/syc-20377503
Shigella infection,"Shigella infection is an illness that affects the intestine. Another name for it is shigellosis. It's caused by a group of germs called shigella bacteria.
Children under age 5 are most likely to get shigella infection. But the illness can happen at any age. The germs that cause it spread easily through an infected person's stool. The germs can get on fingers, on surfaces, or into food or water. Infection happens after the germs are swallowed.
The main symptom of shigella infection is diarrhea that can be bloody or long lasting. Other symptoms can include fever and stomach pain.
Most often, shigella infection clears up on its own within a week. Treatment for serious illness may include medicines called antibiotics that get rid of the germs.
Help prevent shigella infection by washing hands often, especially after changing a diaper or using the bathroom. And if you swim in ponds, lakes or swimming pools, try not to swallow the water.","Symptoms of shigella infection usually start a day or two after contact with the germs that cause it. Sometimes, the illness takes up to a week to start. | Symptoms can include: | Diarrhea that may contain blood or mucus, and that may last more than three days. | Stomach pain or cramps. | A feeling of needing to pass stool even when the bowel is empty. | Fever. | Upset stomach or vomiting. | Symptoms tend to last up to seven days. Sometimes they last longer. Some people have no symptoms after they've been infected with shigella. But the germs may be able to spread through the stool for up to a few weeks.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/shigella/symptoms-causes/syc-20377529

Short bowel syndrome,"Short bowel syndrome is a condition in which the body cannot absorb enough nutrients from foods because part of the small intestine is missing or damaged.
The small intestine is where most of the nutrients you eat are absorbed into your body during digestion.
Short bowel syndrome can happen when:
Short bowel syndrome treatment typically involves special diets and nutritional supplements. It may involve receiving nutrition through a vein, called parenteral nutrition, to prevent malnutrition.","Common symptoms of short bowel syndrome may include: | Diarrhea. | Greasy, foul-smelling stools. | Fatigue. | Weight loss. | Malnutrition. | Swelling, called edema, in the legs and feet.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/short-bowel-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20355091
Dislocated shoulder,"A dislocated shoulder is an injury in which the upper arm bone pops out of the cup-shaped socket that's part of the shoulder blade. The shoulder is the body's most flexible joint, which makes it more likely to dislocate.
If you suspect a dislocated shoulder, seek prompt medical attention. Most people regain full use of their shoulder within a few weeks. However, once a shoulder dislocates, the joint might be prone to repeat dislocations.","Dislocated shoulder symptoms can include: | A visibly deformed or out-of-place shoulder | Swelling or bruising | Intense pain | Inability to move the joint | Shoulder dislocation can also cause numbness, weakness or tingling near the injury, such as in the neck or down the arm. The muscles in the shoulder might spasm, which can increase the pain.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dislocated-shoulder/symptoms-causes/syc-20371715
Multiple system atrophy,"Multiple system atrophy, also called MSA, causes people to lose coordination and balance or become slow and stiff. It also causes changes in speech and loss of control of other bodily functions.
MSA is a rare condition. It sometimes shares symptoms with Parkinson's disease, including slow movement, rigid muscles and poor balance.
Treatment includes medicines and lifestyle changes to help manage symptoms, but there is no cure. The condition gets worse over time and eventually leads to death.
In the past, this condition has been called Shy-Drager syndrome, olivopontocerebellar atrophy or striatonigral degeneration.","Multiple system atrophy (MSA) symptoms affect many parts of the body. Symptoms start in adulthood, usually in the 50s or 60s. | There are two types of MSA: parkinsonian and cerebellar. The type depends on the symptoms a person has when diagnosed.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-system-atrophy/symptoms-causes/syc-20356153

Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS),"Sudden infant death syndrome is the unexplained death of a baby. The baby is usually less than a year old and seems to be healthy. It often happens during sleep. Sudden infant death syndrome also is known asSIDS. It is sometimes called crib death because infants often die in their cribs.
The cause ofSIDSis unknown. But it may be caused by problems in the area of an infant's brain that controls breathing and waking up from sleep.
Researchers have found some things that might put babies at higher risk. They've also found some things you can do to help protect your child fromSIDS. The most important action may be to place a baby on the back to sleep.",,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sudden-infant-death-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20352800

Acute sinusitis,"Acute sinusitis causes the spaces inside the nose, known as sinuses, to become inflamed and swollen. Acute sinusitis makes it hard for the sinuses to drain. Mucus builds up.
Acute sinusitis can make it hard to breathe through the nose. The area around the eyes and the face might feel swollen. There might be throbbing face pain or a headache.
The common cold is the usual cause of acute sinusitis. Most often, the condition clears up within a week to 10 days unless there's also an infection caused by bacteria, called a bacterial infection. Home remedies might be all that's needed to treat acute sinusitis. Sinusitis that lasts more than 12 weeks even with medical treatment is called chronic sinusitis.","Acute sinusitis symptoms often include: | Thick, yellow or greenish mucus from the nose, known as a runny nose, or down the back of the throat, known as postnasal drip. | Blocked or stuffy nose, known as congestion. This makes it hard to breathe through the nose. | Pain, tenderness, swelling and pressure around the eyes, cheeks, nose or forehead that gets worse when bending over. | Other signs and symptoms include: | Ear pressure. | Headache. | Aching in the teeth. | Changed sense of smell. | Cough. | Bad breath. | Tiredness. | Fever.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-sinusitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351671
Chronic sinusitis,"Chronic sinusitis causes the spaces inside the nose and head, called sinuses, to become inflamed and swollen. The condition lasts 12 weeks or longer, even with treatment.
This common condition keeps mucus from draining. It makes the nose stuffy. Breathing through the nose might be hard. The area around the eyes might feel swollen or tender.
Infection, growths in the sinuses, called nasal polyps, and swelling of the lining of the sinuses might all be part of chronic sinusitis. Chronic sinusitis is also called chronic rhinosinusitis. The condition affects adults and children.","Common symptoms of chronic sinusitis include: | Thick, discolored mucus from the nose, known as a runny nose. | Mucus down the back of the throat, known as postnasal drip. | Blocked or stuffy nose, known as congestion. This makes it hard to breathe through the nose. | Pain, tenderness and swelling around the eyes, cheeks, nose or forehead. | Reduced sense of smell and taste. | Other symptoms can include: | Ear pain. | Headache. | Aching in the teeth. | Cough. | Sore throat. | Bad breath. | Tiredness. | Chronic sinusitis and acute sinusitis have similar symptoms. But acute sinusitis is a short-lived infection of the sinuses often linked to a cold. | The symptoms of chronic sinusitis last at least 12 weeks. There might be many bouts of acute sinusitis before it becomes chronic sinusitis. Fever isn't common with chronic sinusitis. But fever might be part of acute sinusitis.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-sinusitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351661
Sjogren's syndrome,"Sjogren's (SHOW-grins) syndrome is a disorder of your immune system identified by its two most common symptoms — dry eyes and a dry mouth.
The condition often accompanies other immune system disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. In Sjogren's syndrome, the mucous membranes and moisture-secreting glands of your eyes and mouth are usually affected first — resulting in decreased tears and saliva.
Although you can develop Sjogren's syndrome at any age, most people are older than 40 at the time of diagnosis. The condition is much more common in women. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms.","The two main symptoms of Sjogren's syndrome are: | Dry eyes.Your eyes might burn, itch or feel gritty — as if there's sand in them. | Dry mouth.Your mouth might feel like it's full of cotton, making it difficult to swallow or speak. | Some people with Sjogren's syndrome also have one or more of the following: | Joint pain, swelling and stiffness | Swollen salivary glands — particularly the set located behind your jaw and in front of your ears | Skin rashes or dry skin | Vaginal dryness | Persistent dry cough | Prolonged fatigue",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sjogrens-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20353216

Skin cancer,"Skin cancer — the abnormal growth of skin cells — most often develops on skin exposed to the sun. But this common form of cancer can also occur on areas of your skin not ordinarily exposed to sunlight.
There are three major types of skin cancer — basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma.
You can reduce your risk of skin cancer by limiting or avoiding exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Checking your skin for suspicious changes can help detect skin cancer at its earliest stages. Early detection of skin cancer gives you the greatest chance for successful skin cancer treatment.",,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/skin-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20377605
Melanoma,"Melanoma is a kind of skin cancer that starts in the melanocytes. Melanocytes are cells that make the pigment that gives skin its color. The pigment is called melanin.
Melanoma typically starts on skin that's often exposed to the sun. This includes the skin on the arms, back, face and legs. Melanoma also can form in the eyes. Rarely, it can happen inside the body, such as in the nose or throat.
The exact cause of all melanomas isn't clear. Most melanomas are caused by exposure to ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet light, also called UV light, comes from sunlight or tanning lamps and beds. Limiting exposure toUVlight can help reduce the risk of melanoma.
The risk of melanoma seems to be increasing in people under 40, especially women. Knowing the symptoms of skin cancer can help ensure that cancerous changes are detected and treated before the cancer has spread. Melanoma can be treated successfully if it is found early.","The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are: | A change in an existing mole. | The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on the skin. | Melanoma doesn't always begin as a mole. It also can happen on otherwise healthy skin. | Melanomas symptoms can happen anywhere on the body. Melanomas most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun. This includes the arms, back, face and legs. | Melanomas also can happen in areas that aren't as exposed to the sun. This includes the soles of the feet, palms of the hands and fingernail beds. Melanoma also can happen inside the body. These hidden melanomas are more common in people with brown or Black skin.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884
Dermatographia (Dermatographism),"Dermatographia is a condition in which lightly scratching your skin causes raised, inflamed lines or welts. These marks tend to go away in less than 30 minutes. The condition is also known as dermatographism and skin writing.
The cause of dermatographia is unknown, but it may be related to an infection, emotional upset or a medicine you're taking.
Dermatographia is harmless. Most people who have this condition don't need treatment. If your symptoms bother you, talk with your health care provider, who might prescribe an allergy medicine.","Symptoms of dermatographia may include: | Raised, inflamed lines where you scratched. | Welts from friction. | Swelling. | Itching. | The symptoms may occur within a few minutes of the skin being rubbed or scratched. They tend to go away within 30 minutes. Rarely, the skin symptoms develop more slowly and lasts several hours to days. The condition itself can last for months or years.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dermatographia/symptoms-causes/syc-20371411
Itchy skin (pruritus),"Itchy skin is an irritating sensation that makes you want to scratch. It's also called pruritus (proo-RIE-tus). Itchy skin is often caused by dry skin and is common in older adults, as skin tends to become drier with age.
Depending on the cause of your itchiness, your skin may look no different than usual or it may be inflamed, rough or have bumps. Repeated scratching can cause raised thick areas of skin that might bleed or become infected.
Many people find relief with self-care measures such as moisturizers, gentle cleansers and lukewarm baths. Long-term relief requires identifying and treating the cause of itchy skin. Common treatments are medicated creams, moist dressings and anti-itch medicines taken by mouth.","Itchy skin can affect small areas, such as the scalp, an arm or a leg. Or it can cover the whole body. Itchy skin can occur without any other noticeable changes on the skin. Or it may come with: | Inflamed skin | Scratch marks | Bumps, spots or blisters | Dry, cracked skin | Leathery or scaly patches | Sometimes itchiness lasts a long time and can be intense. As you rub or scratch the area, it gets itchier. And the more it itches, the more you scratch.

Sleep apnea,"Sleep apnea is a potentially serious sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts. If you snore loudly and feel tired even after a full night's sleep, you might have sleep apnea.
The main types of sleep apnea are:
If you think you might have sleep apnea, see your health care provider. Treatment can ease your symptoms and might help prevent heart problems and other complications.","The symptoms of obstructive and central sleep apneas overlap, sometimes making it difficult to determine which type you have. The most common symptoms of obstructive and central sleep apneas include: | Loud snoring. | Episodes in which you stop breathing during sleep — which would be reported by another person. | Gasping for air during sleep. | Awakening with a dry mouth. | Morning headache. | Difficulty staying asleep, known as insomnia. | Excessive daytime sleepiness, known as hypersomnia. | Difficulty paying attention while awake. | Irritability.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20377631
Central sleep apnea,"Central sleep apnea is a disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep.
Central sleep apnea occurs because the brain doesn't send proper signals to the muscles that control breathing. This condition is different from obstructive sleep apnea, in which breathing stops because the throat muscles relax and block the airway. Central sleep apnea is less common than obstructive sleep apnea.
Central sleep apnea can result from other conditions, such as heart failure and stroke. Another possible cause is sleeping at a high altitude.
Treatments for central sleep apnea might involve managing existing conditions, using a device to assist breathing or using supplemental oxygen.","Common symptoms of central sleep apnea include: | Observed episodes of not breathing during sleep. | Sudden awakenings with shortness of breath. | Not being able to stay asleep, known as insomnia. | Excessive daytime sleepiness, known as hypersomnia. | Trouble focusing. | Mood changes. | Morning headaches. | Snoring. | Although snoring suggests some degree of a blocked airway, snoring also can occur in people with central sleep apnea. However, snoring may not be as prominent with central sleep apnea as it is with obstructive sleep apnea.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/central-sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20352109
Obstructive sleep apnea,"Obstructive sleep apnea is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder. People with obstructive sleep apnea repeatedly stop and start breathing while they sleep.
There are several types of sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when the throat muscles relax and block the airway. This happens off and on many times during sleep. A sign of obstructive sleep apnea is snoring.
Treatments for obstructive sleep apnea are available. One treatment is a device that uses positive pressure to keep the airway open during sleep. Another option is a mouthpiece to thrust the lower jaw forward during sleep. In some people, surgery might be an option too.","Symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea include: | Excessive daytime sleepiness. | Loud snoring. | Observed episodes of stopped breathing during sleep. | Waking during the night and gasping or choking. | Awakening in the morning with a dry mouth or sore throat. | Morning headaches. | Trouble focusing during the day. | Mood changes, such as depression or being easily upset. | High blood pressure. | Decreased interest in sex.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obstructive-sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20352090
Sleep terrors (night terrors),"Sleep terrors are times of screaming or crying, intense fear, and sometimes waving arms and legs when not fully awake. Also known as night terrors, sleep terrors may lead to sleepwalking. Like sleepwalking, sleep terrors are a type of parasomnia. Parasomnias are disturbing or strange behaviors or experiences during sleep. A sleep terror usually lasts from seconds to a few minutes, but it may last longer.
Sleep terrors may happen in children between the ages of 1 and 12 years. They happen much less often in adults. Although sleep terrors can be frightening to those around the person with sleep terrors, they aren't usually a cause for concern. Most children outgrow sleep terrors by their teenage years.
Sleep terrors may need treatment if they cause problems with getting enough sleep or cause a safety risk.","Sleep terrors differ from nightmares. A nightmare is a bad dream. The person who has a nightmare wakes up from the dream and may remember details. A person who has a sleep terror remains asleep. Children usually don't remember anything about their sleep terrors in the morning. Adults may recall part of a dream they had during the sleep terrors. | Sleep terrors generally happen in the first part of sleep time, and rarely during naps. A sleep terror may lead to sleepwalking. | During a sleep terror, a person may: | Start by screaming, shouting or crying. | Sit up in bed and look scared. | Stare wide-eyed. | Sweat, breathe heavily, and have a racing pulse, flushed face and enlarged pupils. | Kick and thrash. | Be hard to wake up and be confused if awakened. | Not be comforted or soothed. | Have no or little memory of the event the next morning. | Possibly, get out of bed and run around the house or have aggressive behavior if blocked or held back.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-terrors/symptoms-causes/syc-20353524
Narcolepsy,"Narcolepsy is a condition that makes people very sleepy during the day and can cause them to fall asleep suddenly. Some people also have other symptoms, such as muscle weakness when they feel strong emotions.
The symptoms can have serious effects on daily life. People with narcolepsy have trouble staying awake for long periods of time. When narcolepsy causes a sudden loss of muscle tone, it is known as cataplexy (KAT-uh-plek-see). This can be triggered by a strong emotion, especially one that causes laughter.
Narcolepsy is divided into two types. Most people with type 1 narcolepsy have cataplexy. Most people with type 2 narcolepsy don't have cataplexy.
Narcolepsy is a lifelong condition and does not have a cure. However, medicines and lifestyle changes can help manage the symptoms. Support from family, friends, employers and teachers can help people cope with the condition.","The symptoms of narcolepsy may get worse during the first few years. Then they continue for life. Symptoms include: | Extreme daytime sleepiness.Daytime sleepiness is the first symptom to appear, and the sleepiness makes it hard to focus and function. People with narcolepsy feel less alert and focused during the day. They also fall asleep without warning. Sleep can happen anywhere and at any time. It may happen when they are bored or while doing a task. For example, people with narcolepsy can suddenly fall asleep while working or talking with friends. It can be especially dangerous to fall asleep while driving. Sleep may last only a few minutes or up to a half-hour. After waking, people with narcolepsy feel refreshed but get sleepy again. | Automatic behaviors.Some people with narcolepsy continue doing a task when they fall asleep briefly. For example, they may fall asleep while writing, typing or driving. They might continue to perform that task while asleep. After waking, they can't remember what they did, and they probably didn't do it well. | Sudden loss of muscle tone.This condition is called cataplexy. It can cause slurred speech or complete weakness of most muscles for up to a few minutes. It's triggered by intense emotions — often positive emotions. Laughter or excitement may cause sudden muscle weakness. But sometimes fear, surprise or anger can cause the loss of muscle tone. For example, when you laugh, your head may drop without your control. Or your knees may suddenly lose strength, causing you to fall. Some people with narcolepsy experience only one or two episodes of cataplexy a year. Others have several episodes a day. Not everyone with narcolepsy has these symptoms. | Sleep paralysis.People with narcolepsy may experience sleep paralysis. During sleep paralysis, the person can't move or speak while falling asleep or upon waking. The paralysis is usually brief — lasting a few seconds or minutes. But it can be scary. You may be aware of it happening and can recall it afterward. Not everyone with sleep paralysis has narcolepsy. | Hallucinations.Sometimes people see things that aren't there during sleep paralysis. Hallucinations also may happen in bed without sleep paralysis. These are called hypnagogic hallucinations if they happen as you fall asleep. They're called hypnopompic hallucinations if they happen upon waking. For example, the person might think they see a stranger in the bedroom who isn't there. These hallucinations may be vivid and frightening because you may not be fully asleep when you begin dreaming. | Changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.REM sleep is when most dreaming happens. Typically, people enter REM sleep 60 to 90 minutes after falling asleep. But people with narcolepsy often move more quickly to REM sleep. They tend to enter REM sleep within 15 minutes of falling asleep. REM sleep also can happen at any time of the day.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcolepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20375497
Insomnia,"Insomnia is a common sleep disorder that can make it hard to fall asleep or stay asleep. It also can cause you to wake up too early and not be able to get back to sleep. You may still feel tired when you wake up. Insomnia can drain your energy level and affect your mood. It also can affect your health, work performance and quality of life.
How much sleep is enough varies from person to person. But most adults need 7 to 9 hours a night.
At some point, many adults have short-term insomnia. This can last for days or weeks. Short-term insomnia is usually due to stress or a distressing event. But some people have long-term insomnia, also called chronic insomnia. This lasts for three months or more. Insomnia may be the main problem, or it may be related to other medical conditions or medicines.
You do not have to put up with sleepless nights. Simple changes in your daily habits often can help.","Insomnia symptoms may include: | Having a hard time falling asleep at night. | Waking up during the night. | Waking up too early. | Feeling tired or sleepy during the day. | Feeling cranky, depressed or anxious. | Having a hard time paying attention, focusing on tasks or remembering. | Making more errors or having more accidents. | Having ongoing worries about sleep.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/insomnia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355167
Sleepwalking,"Sleepwalking, also known as somnambulism, is when people get up and walk around while asleep. It's more common in children than adults. Children usually outgrow sleepwalking by the teen years. Sleepwalking that happens once in a while often isn't a serious problem and doesn't need treatment. But sleepwalking that happens a lot may suggest an underlying sleep disorder.
Sleepwalking in adults is more likely to be confused with, or happen as part of, other sleep disorders. Medical conditions also can cause people to walk in their sleep.
If people in your household sleepwalk, it's important to take steps to help prevent them from getting injured while sleepwalking.","Sleepwalking usually occurs early in the night — often 1 to 2 hours after falling asleep. It isn't likely to happen during naps, but it is possible. A bout of sleepwalking can occur rarely or often. A bout generally lasts several minutes, but it can last longer. | People who sleepwalk may: | Get out of bed and walk around. | Sit up in bed and open their eyes. | Have a glazed, glassy-eyed expression. | Not respond or talk to others. | Be hard to wake up. | Be confused for a short time after waking up. | Not remember in the morning that they sleepwalked. | Have problems functioning during the day because of disturbed sleep. | Also have sleep terrors that cause screaming and waving of arms and legs. | Sometimes, people who sleepwalk will: | Do routine activities, such as getting dressed, talking or eating. | Leave the house. | Drive a car. | Take part in unusual behavior, such as passing urine in a closet. | Take part in sexual activity without being aware of it. | Get injured, such as by falling down the stairs or jumping out a window. | Become violent while briefly confused after waking up or once in a while sleepwalking.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleepwalking/symptoms-causes/syc-20353506
Herniated disk,"A herniated disk refers to a problem with one of the rubbery cushions, called disks, that sit between the bones that stack to make the spine. These bones are called vertebrae.
A spinal disk has a soft, jellylike center called a nucleus. The nucleus is encased in a tougher, rubbery exterior, known as the annulus. A herniated disk occurs when some of the nucleus pushes out through a tear in the annulus. A herniated disk is sometimes called a slipped disk or a ruptured disk.
A herniated disk, which can occur in any part of the spine, most often occurs in the lower back. Depending on where the herniated disk is, it can result in pain, numbness or weakness in an arm or a leg.
Many people have no symptoms from a herniated disk. For people who do have symptoms, the symptoms tend to improve over time. Surgery is usually not needed to relieve the problem.","Most herniated disks occur in the lower back, but they also can occur in the neck. Symptoms depend on where the disk is sitting and whether the disk is pressing on a nerve. Herniated disks often affect one side of the body. | Arm or leg pain.If your herniated disk is in your lower back, you'll typically feel pain in your lower back, buttocks, thigh and calf. You might have pain in part of your foot as well.For a herniated disk in your neck, you'll typically feel the most pain in your shoulder and arm. This pain might shoot into your arm or leg when you cough, sneeze or move into certain positions. Pain is often described as sharp or burning. | Numbness or tingling.People who have herniated disks often have radiating numbness or tingling in the body part served by the affected nerves. | Weakness.Muscles served by the affected nerves tend to weaken. This can cause you to stumble or affect your ability to lift or hold items. | You can have a herniated disk without symptoms. You might not know you have it unless it shows up on a spinal image.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/herniated-disk/symptoms-causes/syc-20354095
Bradycardia,"Bradycardia (brad-e-KAHR-dee-uh) is a slow heart rate. The hearts of adults at rest usually beat between 60 and 100 times a minute. If you have bradycardia, your heart beats fewer than 60 times a minute.
Bradycardia can be a serious problem if the heart rate is very slow and the heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the body. If this happens, you may feel dizzy, very tired or weak, and short of breath. Sometimes bradycardia doesn't cause symptoms or complications.
A slow heart rate isn't always a concern. For example, a resting heart rate between 40 and 60 beats a minute is common in some people, particularly healthy young adults and trained athletes. It also is quite common during sleep.
If bradycardia is severe, a pacemaker may be needed to help the heart beat at an appropriate rate.","A slower than typical heartbeat is called bradycardia. If the slow heartbeat stops the brain and other organs from getting enough oxygen, symptoms may include: | Chest pain. | Confusion or memory problems. | Dizziness or lightheadedness. | Feeling very tired, especially during physical activity. | Fainting or near-fainting. | Shortness of breath.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bradycardia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355474
Small bowel cancer,"Small bowel cancer is a type of cancer that starts as a growth of cells in the small intestine. The small intestine, also called the small bowel, is a long tube that carries digested food between the stomach and the large intestine.
The small intestine digests and absorbs nutrients from the foods you eat. It produces hormones that help with digestion. The small intestine also plays a role in the body's germ-fighting immune system. It contains cells that fight bacteria and viruses that enter the body through the mouth.
Small bowel cancer treatment usually involves surgery to remove the cancer. Other treatments include chemotherapy and targeted therapy, which use medicines to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy also may be used to shrink the cancer before surgery.","Symptoms of small bowel cancer include: | Abdominal pain. | Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, called jaundice. | Feeling very weak or tired. | Nausea. | Vomiting. | Losing weight without trying. | Blood in the stool, which might look red or black. | Watery diarrhea. | Skin flushing.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/small-bowel-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352497
Small bowel prolapse (enterocele),"Small bowel prolapse, also called enterocele (EN-tur-o-seel), occurs when the small intestine (small bowel) descends into the lower pelvic cavity and pushes at the top part of the vagina, creating a bulge. The word ""prolapse"" means to slip or fall out of place.
Childbirth, aging and other processes that put pressure on your pelvic floor may weaken the muscles and ligaments that support pelvic organs, making small bowel prolapse more likely to occur.
To manage small bowel prolapse, self-care measures and other nonsurgical options are often effective. In severe cases, you may need surgery to fix the prolapse.","Mild small bowel prolapse may produce no signs or symptoms. However, if you have significant prolapse, you might experience: | A pulling sensation in your pelvis that eases when you lie down | A feeling of pelvic fullness, pressure or pain | Low back pain that eases when you lie down | A soft bulge of tissue in your vagina | Vaginal discomfort and painful intercourse (dyspareunia) | Many women with small bowel prolapse also experience prolapse of other pelvic organs, such as the bladder, uterus or rectum.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/enterocele/symptoms-causes/syc-20377661

Smallpox,"Smallpox is a serious and often deadly viral infection. It's contagious — meaning it spreads from person to person — and can cause permanent scarring. Sometimes, it causes disfigurement.
Smallpox has affected humans for thousands of years but was wiped out worldwide by 1980 thanks to smallpox vaccines. It's no longer found naturally in the world. The last case of naturally occurring smallpox was reported in 1977.
Samples of smallpox virus have been kept for research purposes. And scientific advances have made it possible to create smallpox in a lab. This has led to concerns that smallpox could someday be used as a bioweapon.
Vaccines can prevent smallpox, but because most people are unlikely to come in contact with smallpox naturally, routine vaccination isn't recommended. New antiviral medications can be used to treat people who develop smallpox.","The first symptoms of smallpox usually appear 12 to 14 days after you're exposed to the smallpox virus. However, the virus can be in your body from 7 to 19 days before you look or feel sick. This time is called the incubation period. | After the incubation period, sudden flu-like symptoms occur. These include: | Fever | Muscle aches | Headache | Severe fatigue | Severe back pain | Vomiting, sometimes | A few days later, flat, red spots appear on the body. They may start in the mouth and on the tongue and then spread to the skin. The face, arms and legs are often affected first, followed by the torso, hands and feet. | Within a day or two, many of the spots turn into small blisters filled with clear fluid. Later, the blisters fill with pus. These sores are called pustules. Scabs form 8 to 9 days later and eventually fall off, leaving deep, pitted scars. | Smallpox can be spread from person to person when the rash appears and until the scabs fall off.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/smallpox/symptoms-causes/syc-20353027
Snoring,"Snoring is the hoarse or harsh sound that occurs when air flows past relaxed tissues in your throat, causing the tissues to vibrate as you breathe. Nearly everyone snores now and then, but for some people it can be a chronic problem. Sometimes it may also indicate a serious health condition. In addition, snoring can be a nuisance to your partner.
Lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, avoiding alcohol close to bedtime or sleeping on your side, can help stop snoring.
In addition, medical devices and surgery are available that may reduce disruptive snoring. However, these aren't suitable or necessary for everyone who snores.","Snoring is often associated with a sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Not all snorers have OSA, but if snoring is accompanied by any of the following symptoms, it may be an indication to see a doctor for further evaluation for OSA: | Witnessed breathing pauses during sleep | Excessive daytime sleepiness | Difficulty concentrating | Morning headaches | Sore throat upon awakening | Restless sleep | Gasping or choking at night | High blood pressure | Chest pain at night | Your snoring is so loud it's disrupting your partner's sleep | In children, poor attention span, behavioral issues or poor performance in school | OSA often is characterized by loud snoring followed by periods of silence when breathing stops or nearly stops. Eventually, this reduction or pause in breathing may signal you to wake up, and you may awaken with a loud snort or gasping sound. | You may sleep lightly due to disrupted sleep. This pattern of breathing pauses may be repeated many times during the night. | People with obstructive sleep apnea usually experience periods when breathing slows or stops at least five times during every hour of sleep.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/snoring/symptoms-causes/syc-20377694
Social anxiety disorder (social phobia),"It's normal to feel nervous in some social situations. For example, going on a date or giving a presentation may cause that feeling of butterflies in your stomach. But in social anxiety disorder, also called social phobia, everyday interactions cause significant anxiety, self-consciousness and embarrassment because you fear being scrutinized or judged negatively by others.
In social anxiety disorder, fear and anxiety lead to avoidance that can disrupt your life. Severe stress can affect your relationships, daily routines, work, school or other activities.
Social anxiety disorder can be a chronic mental health condition, but learning coping skills in psychotherapy and taking medications can help you gain confidence and improve your ability to interact with others.","Feelings of shyness or discomfort in certain situations aren't necessarily signs of social anxiety disorder, particularly in children. Comfort levels in social situations vary, depending on personality traits and life experiences. Some people are naturally reserved and others are more outgoing. | In contrast to everyday nervousness, social anxiety disorder includes fear, anxiety and avoidance that interfere with relationships, daily routines, work, school or other activities. Social anxiety disorder typically begins in the early to mid-teens, though it can sometimes start in younger children or in adults. | Signs and symptoms of social anxiety disorder can include constant: | Fear of situations in which you may be judged negatively | Worry about embarrassing or humiliating yourself | Intense fear of interacting or talking with strangers | Fear that others will notice that you look anxious | Fear of physical symptoms that may cause you embarrassment, such as blushing, sweating, trembling or having a shaky voice | Avoidance of doing things or speaking to people out of fear of embarrassment | Avoidance of situations where you might be the center of attention | Anxiety in anticipation of a feared activity or event | Intense fear or anxiety during social situations | Analysis of your performance and identification of flaws in your interactions after a social situation | Expectation of the worst possible consequences from a negative experience during a social situation | For children, anxiety about interacting with adults or peers may be shown by crying, having temper tantrums, clinging to parents or refusing to speak in social situations. | Performance type of social anxiety disorder is when you experience intense fear and anxiety during speaking or performing in public but not in other types of more general social situations. | Physical signs and symptoms can sometimes accompany social anxiety disorder and may include: | Blushing | Fast heartbeat | Trembling | Sweating | Upset stomach or nausea | Trouble catching your breath | Dizziness or lightheadedness | Feeling that your mind has gone blank | Muscle tension | Common, everyday experiences may be hard to endure when you have social anxiety disorder, including: | Interacting with unfamiliar people or strangers | Attending parties or social gatherings | Going to work or school | Starting conversations | Making eye contact | Dating | Entering a room in which people are already seated | Returning items to a store | Eating in front of others | Using a public restroom | Social anxiety disorder symptoms can change over time. They may flare up if you're facing a lot of changes, stress or demands in your life. Although avoiding situations that produce anxiety may make you feel better in the short term, your anxiety is likely to continue over the long term if you don't get treatment. | See your doctor or a mental health professional if you fear and avoid normal social situations because they cause embarrassment, worry or panic.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/social-anxiety-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20353561

Somatic symptom disorder,"Somatic symptom disorder is characterized by an extreme focus on physical symptoms — such as pain or fatigue — that causes major emotional distress and problems functioning. You may or may not have another diagnosed medical condition associated with these symptoms, but your reaction to the symptoms is not normal.
You often think the worst about your symptoms and frequently seek medical care, continuing to search for an explanation even when other serious conditions have been excluded. Health concerns may become such a central focus of your life that it's hard to function, sometimes leading to disability.
If you have somatic symptom disorder, you may experience significant emotional and physical distress. Treatment can help ease symptoms, help you cope and improve your quality of life.","Symptoms of somatic symptom disorder may be: | Specific sensations, such as pain or shortness of breath, or more general symptoms, such as fatigue or weakness | Unrelated to any medical cause that can be identified, or related to a medical condition such as cancer or heart disease, but more significant than what's usually expected | A single symptom, multiple symptoms or varying symptoms | Mild, moderate or severe | Pain is the most common symptom, but whatever your symptoms, you have excessive thoughts, feelings or behaviors related to those symptoms, which cause significant problems, make it difficult to function and sometimes can be disabling. | These thoughts, feelings and behaviors can include: | Constant worry about potential illness | Viewing normal physical sensations as a sign of severe physical illness | Fearing that symptoms are serious, even when there is no evidence | Thinking that physical sensations are threatening or harmful | Feeling that medical evaluation and treatment have not been adequate | Fearing that physical activity may cause damage to your body | Repeatedly checking your body for abnormalities | Frequent health care visits that don't relieve your concerns or that make them worse | Being unresponsive to medical treatment or unusually sensitive to medication side effects | Having a more severe impairment than is usually expected from a medical condition | For somatic symptom disorder, more important than the specific physical symptoms you experience is the way you interpret and react to the symptoms and how they impact your daily life.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/somatic-symptom-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20377776

Specific phobias,"Specific phobias are an extreme fear of objects or situations that pose little or no danger but make you highly anxious. So you try to stay away from these things. Unlike the brief anxiety you may feel when giving a speech or taking a test, specific phobias are long-lasting. Without treatment, specific phobias tend to last a lifetime.
Phobias can cause strong physical, mental and emotional responses. They also can affect how you act at work or school, or in social situations.
Specific phobias are common anxiety disorders. Overall, they happen more often in females. Not all phobias need to be treated. But if a specific phobia affects your daily life, several types of therapies are available to help you work through and conquer your fears — often forever.","A specific phobia involves a strong, lasting fear of a certain object or situation that's much greater than the actual risk. There are many types of phobias. It's common to have a specific phobia about more than one object or situation. Specific phobias also can happen along with other types of anxiety disorders. | Common types of specific phobias are fears of: | Situations, such as airplanes, driving, enclosed spaces or going to school. | Nature, such as thunderstorms, heights or the dark. | Animals or insects, such as dogs, snakes or spiders. | Blood, shots or injuries, such as needles, accidents or medical procedures. | Others, such as choking, throwing up, loud noises or clowns. | Each specific phobia has a name. Phobia comes from the Greek word ""phobos,"" which means fear. Examples of more common names include acrophobia for the fear of heights and claustrophobia for the fear of confined spaces. | No matter what specific phobia you have, you may: | Feel intense fear, anxiety and panic right away when exposed to or even thinking about what causes your fear. | Know that your fears are not reasonable or not as big as you think they are, but you cannot control them. | Have anxiety that gets worse as the situation or object gets closer to you physically or in time. | Do everything possible to stay away from an object or situation or face it with extreme anxiety or fear. | Have trouble with daily activities because of your fear. | Have physical reactions and feelings, including sweating, rapid heartbeat, tight chest or trouble breathing. | Feel like throwing up, or you get dizzy or faint, especially around blood or injuries. | Children may have tantrums, or they may cling, cry or refuse to leave a parent's side or approach their fear. | When to see a doctor | An extreme fear can make life hard — for example, taking long flights of stairs instead of an elevator. But it is not a specific phobia unless it seriously disrupts your life. If anxiety negatively affects the way you act at work or school, or in social situations, talk with your doctor or another health care professional, or a mental health professional. | Childhood fears, such as fear of the dark, monsters or of being left alone, are common. Most children outgrow them. But if your child has an ongoing, strong fear that interferes with how they act at school or work daily, talk to your child's doctor. | The right therapy can help most people. And the sooner you ask for help, the more likely that therapy will be effective.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/specific-phobias/symptoms-causes/syc-20355156
Dyslexia,"Dyslexia is a learning disorder that involves difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words (decoding). Also called a reading disability, dyslexia is a result of individual differences in areas of the brain that process language.
Dyslexia is not due to problems with intelligence, hearing or vision. Most children with dyslexia can succeed in school with tutoring or a specialized education program. Emotional support also plays an important role.
Though there's no cure for dyslexia, early assessment and intervention result in the best outcome. Sometimes dyslexia goes undiagnosed for years and isn't recognized until adulthood, but it's never too late to seek help.","Signs of dyslexia can be difficult to recognize before your child enters school, but some early clues may indicate a problem. Once your child reaches school age, your child's teacher may be the first to notice a problem. Severity varies, but the condition often becomes apparent as a child starts learning to read.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dyslexia/symptoms-causes/syc-20353552

Spina bifida,"Spina bifida is a condition that occurs when the spine and spinal cord don't form properly. It's a type of neural tube defect. The neural tube is the structure in a developing embryo that later becomes the baby's brain and spinal cord and the tissues that enclose them.
Typically, the neural tube forms early in pregnancy and closes by the 28th day after conception. In babies with spina bifida, a portion of the neural tube doesn't close all the way. This affects the spinal cord and bones of the spine.
Spina bifida can range from being mild to causing serious disabilities. Symptoms depend on where on the spine the opening is located and how big it is. Symptoms also depend on whether the spinal cord and nerves are involved. When necessary, early treatment for spina bifida involves surgery. However, surgery doesn't always completely restore lost function.","Symptoms of spina bifida vary by type and from one person to another. | Spina bifida occulta.Typically, there aren't any symptoms of spina bifida occulta because the spinal nerves aren't involved. But you can sometimes see symptoms on the newborn's skin above the small gap in the spine. You might see a tuft of hair, a small dimple or a birthmark. Sometimes, these skin marks can be symptoms of a spinal cord issue that can be found withMRIor a spinal ultrasound in a newborn. | Meningocele.This type may affect bladder and bowel function. | Myelomeningocele.In this most serious type of spina bifida, the spinal canal remains open along several vertebrae in the lower or middle back. The membranes and part of the spinal cord or nerves protrude at birth, forming a sac. Tissues and nerves usually are exposed, though sometimes skin covers the sac. Babies with this type of spina bifida may have trouble with bladder and bowel function. They also may experience weakness or lack of movement in the legs. Babies may have a buildup of fluid in the brain called hydrocephalus that can put pressure on brain tissue.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/spina-bifida/symptoms-causes/syc-20377860
Spinal cord tumor,"A spinal cord tumor is a growth of cells that forms in or around the spinal cord. The spinal cord extends downward from the base of the brain. It's made up of nerve cells and groups of nerves that carry messages between the brain and the rest of the body. The bones of the spine surround and protect the spinal cord.
Spinal cord tumors also are called intradural tumors or spinal tumors.
Most spinal cord tumors aren't cancers, but some are cancerous. Spinal cord tumors that aren't cancers also are called benign spinal cord tumors. Spinal cord tumors that are cancers also are called malignant spinal cord tumors or spinal cord cancers.
Many types of spinal cord tumors exist. The different types of spinal cord tumors are often divided up by where they happen.
Spinal cord tumors can happen anywhere along the spinal cord. Most happen in the upper back. Less often the tumors happen in the neck or lower back.
Spinal cord tumors can cause pain in the neck or back near where they are growing. They also can cause loss of function in the part of the body that's controlled by the nerves involved in the tumor.
Spinal cord tumor treatment depends on the type of tumor and where it is in the spine. Treatments may include surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.","Spinal cord tumors may not cause signs and symptoms at first. When symptoms happen, they might start in the part of the spine near the tumor. As a spinal cord tumor grows, it can hurt nearby nerves and cause symptoms in other parts of the body. | In the spine, spinal cord tumor symptoms include: | Pain near the spot where the tumor forms. | Pain that feels worse at night. | Pain that feels like it extends or shoots from the back to nearby areas. | Pain that gets worse over time. | A spinal cord tumor that grows to hurt the nearby nerves can cause symptoms that happen along those nerves. Symptoms may include: | Changes in feeling in one part of the body, such as being less sensitive to pain, heat and cold. | Loss of bowel or bladder function. | Muscle weakness in one part of the body. | Trouble with walking, which can lead to falls. | Spinal cord tumors happen rarely in children. Symptoms of spinal cord tumors in children include: | A new curve in the spine. | Back or neck pain that often is worse at night. | Changes in the way the child walks, including falling and tripping more than usual. | Loss of mobility. For example, a child who learned to walk may seem to prefer crawling. A child who learned to stand may no longer try to stand. | Muscle weakness.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/spinal-cord-tumor/symptoms-causes/syc-20350103
Spinal stenosis,"Spinal stenosis happens when the space inside the backbone is too small. This can put pressure on the spinal cord and nerves that travel through the spine. Spinal stenosis happens most often in the lower back and the neck.
Some people with spinal stenosis have no symptoms. Others may experience pain, tingling, numbness and muscle weakness. Symptoms can get worse over time.
The most common cause of spinal stenosis is wear-and-tear damage in the spine related to arthritis. People who have serious spinal stenosis may need surgery.
Surgery can create more space inside the spine. This can ease the symptoms caused by pressure on the spinal cord or nerves. But surgery can't cure arthritis, so arthritis pain in the spine may continue.","Spinal stenosis often causes no symptoms. When symptoms do happen, they start slowly and get worse over time. Symptoms depend on which part of the spine is affected.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/spinal-stenosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352961
Enlarged spleen (splenomegaly),"Your spleen is an organ that sits just below your left rib cage. Many conditions — including infections, liver disease and some cancers — can cause an enlarged spleen. An enlarged spleen is also known as splenomegaly (spleh-no-MEG-uh-lee).
An enlarged spleen usually doesn't cause symptoms. It's often discovered during a routine physical exam. A doctor usually can't feel the spleen in an adult unless it's enlarged. Imaging and blood tests can help identify the cause of an enlarged spleen.
Treatment for an enlarged spleen depends on what's causing it. Surgery to remove an enlarged spleen usually isn't needed, but sometimes it's recommended.","An enlarged spleen typically causes no signs or symptoms, but sometimes it causes: | Pain or fullness in the left upper belly that can spread to the left shoulder | A feeling of fullness without eating or after eating a small amount because the spleen is pressing on your stomach | Low red blood cells (anemia) | Frequent infections | Bleeding easily",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/enlarged-spleen/symptoms-causes/syc-20354326

Sprained ankle,"A sprained ankle is an injury that occurs when you roll, twist or turn your ankle in an awkward way. This can stretch or tear the tough bands of tissue (ligaments) that help hold your ankle bones together.
Ligaments help stabilize joints, preventing excessive movement. A sprained ankle occurs when the ligaments are forced beyond their normal range of motion. Most sprained ankles involve injuries to the ligaments on the outer side of the ankle.
Treatment for a sprained ankle depends on the severity of the injury. Although self-care measures and over-the-counter pain medications may be all you need, a medical evaluation might be necessary to reveal how badly you've sprained your ankle and to determine the appropriate treatment.","Signs and symptoms of a sprained ankle vary depending on the severity of the injury. They may include: | Pain, especially when you bear weight on the affected foot | Tenderness when you touch the ankle | Swelling | Bruising | Restricted range of motion | Instability in the ankle | Popping sensation or sound at the time of injury",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sprained-ankle/symptoms-causes/syc-20353225
Sprains,"A sprain is a stretching or tearing of ligaments — the tough bands of fibrous tissue that connect two bones together in your joints. The most common location for a sprain is in your ankle.
Initial treatment includes rest, ice, compression and elevation. Mild sprains can be successfully treated at home. Severe sprains sometimes require surgery to repair torn ligaments.
The difference between a sprain and a strain is that a sprain injures the bands of tissue that connect two bones together, while a strain involves an injury to a muscle or to the band of tissue that attaches a muscle to a bone.","Signs and symptoms will vary, depending on the severity of the injury, and may include: | Pain | Swelling | Bruising | Limited ability to move the affected joint | Hearing or feeling a ""pop"" in your joint at the time of injury",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sprains/symptoms-causes/syc-20377938
Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin,"Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is a type of cancer that starts as a growth of cells on the skin. It starts in cells called squamous cells. The squamous cells make up the middle and outer layers of the skin. Squamous cell carcinoma is a common type of skin cancer.
Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is usually not life-threatening. But if it's not treated, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin can grow large or spread to other parts of the body. The growth of the cancer can cause serious complications.
Most squamous cell carcinomas of the skin are caused by too much ultraviolet (UV) radiation.UVradiation comes either from sunlight or from tanning beds or lamps. Protecting your skin fromUVlight can help reduce the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and other forms of skin cancer.
Squamous cell carcinomas can be anywhere on the skin. In people who sunburn easily, the cancer is usually found on areas of skin that have had a lot of sun. In people with Black and brown skin, squamous cell carcinomas are more likely to be on skin that isn't exposed to sun, such as the genitals.","Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin most often occurs on sun-exposed skin. This includes the scalp, the backs of the hands, the ears or the lips. But it can occur anywhere on the body. It can even occur inside the mouth, on the bottoms of the feet or on the genitals. When squamous cell carcinoma of the skin happens in people with Black and brown skin, it tends to happen in places that aren't exposed to the sun. | Symptoms of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin include: | A firm bump on the skin, called a nodule. The nodule might be the same color as the skin, or it might look different. It can look pink, red, black or brown, depending on skin color. | A flat sore with a scaly crust. | A new sore or raised area on an old scar or sore. | A rough, scaly patch on the lip that may become an open sore. | A sore or rough patch inside the mouth. | A raised patch or wartlike sore on or in the anus or on the genitals.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/squamous-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352480
Metastatic prostate cancer,"Metastatic prostate cancer is cancer that starts in the prostate and spreads to other parts of the body. Other terms for this condition include advanced prostate cancer and stage 4 prostate cancer.
Prostate cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the prostate. The prostate is a small gland that helps make the fluid part of semen. It's found just below the bladder. The prostate is part of the male reproductive system.
Most prostate cancers are found when the cancer is only in the prostate. It's less common for someone to have metastatic prostate cancer when first diagnosed with prostate cancer. Metastatic prostate cancer happens most often in people who had treatment for prostate cancer in the past.
There are many treatments for metastatic prostate cancer. Treatments aren't likely to cure the cancer, but they can slow its growth.","Metastatic prostate cancer doesn't always cause symptoms. As the cancer grows and becomes more advanced, symptoms might happen. Signs and symptoms of metastatic prostate cancer can include: | Feeling very tired. | Having to urinate more often or feeling pain when urinating. | Losing weight without trying. | Nausea and vomiting. | Pain, which might be felt in the back, hips, pelvic area or in a bone.

Progressive supranuclear palsy,"Progressive supranuclear palsy is a rare brain disease that affects walking, balance, eye movements and swallowing. The disease results from the damage of cells in areas of the brain that control body movement, coordination, thinking and other important functions. Progressive supranuclear palsy also is called Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome.
Progressive supranuclear palsy worsens over time and can lead to dangerous complications, such as pneumonia and trouble swallowing. There's no cure for progressive supranuclear palsy, so treatment focuses on managing the symptoms.","Symptoms of progressive supranuclear palsy include: | A loss of balance while walking.A tendency to fall backward can occur very early in the disease. | An inability to aim your eyes properly.People with progressive supranuclear palsy may not be able to look downward. Or they may experience blurring and double vision. Not being able to focus the eyes can make some people spill food. They also may appear disinterested in conversation because of lack of eye contact. | Additional symptoms of progressive supranuclear palsy vary and may mimic those of Parkinson's disease and dementia. Symptoms get worse over time and may include: | Stiffness, especially of the neck, and awkward movements. | Falling, especially falling backward. | Slow or slurred speech. | Trouble swallowing, which may cause gagging or choking. | Being sensitive to bright light. | Trouble with sleep. | Loss of interest in pleasurable activities. | Impulsive behavior, or laughing or crying for no reason. | Trouble with reasoning, problem-solving and decision-making. | Depression and anxiety. | A surprised or frightened facial expression, resulting from rigid facial muscles. | Dizziness.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/progressive-supranuclear-palsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20355659
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a problem with hormones that happens during the reproductive years. If you havePCOS, you may not have periods very often. Or you may have periods that last many days. You may also have too much of a hormone called androgen in your body.
WithPCOS, many small sacs of fluid develop along the outer edge of the ovary. These are called cysts. The small fluid-filled cysts contain immature eggs. These are called follicles. The follicles fail to regularly release eggs.
The exact cause ofPCOSis unknown. Early diagnosis and treatment along with weight loss may lower the risk of long-term complications such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease.","Symptoms ofPCOSoften start around the time of the first menstrual period. Sometimes symptoms develop later after you have had periods for a while. | The symptoms ofPCOSvary. A diagnosis ofPCOSis made when you have at least two of these: | Irregular periods.Having few menstrual periods or having periods that aren't regular are common signs ofPCOS. So is having periods that last for many days or longer than is typical for a period. For example, you might have fewer than nine periods a year. And those periods may occur more than 35 days apart. You may have trouble getting pregnant. | Too much androgen.High levels of the hormone androgen may result in excess facial and body hair. This is called hirsutism. Sometimes, severe acne and male-pattern baldness can happen, too. | Polycystic ovaries.Your ovaries might be bigger. Many follicles containing immature eggs may develop around the edge of the ovary. The ovaries might not work the way they should. | PCOSsigns and symptoms are typically more severe in people with obesity.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pcos/symptoms-causes/syc-20353439
Trigger finger,"Trigger finger makes a finger get stuck in a bent position. It may straighten suddenly with a snap. The fingers most often affected are the ring finger and the thumb, but the condition can affect any finger.
Trigger finger happens when the tendon that controls that finger can't glide smoothly in the sheath that surrounds it. This may occur if part of the tendon sheath becomes swollen or if a small lump forms on the tendon.
The condition is most common in women over the age of 50. You may be at higher risk of trigger finger if you have diabetes, low thyroid function or rheumatoid arthritis.
Treatment of trigger finger can include splinting, steroid injections or surgery.","Symptoms of trigger finger may progress from mild to severe and include: | Finger stiffness, particularly in the morning. | A popping or clicking sensation as the finger moves. | Tenderness or a bump in the palm at the base of the affected finger. | Finger catching or locking in a bent position, which suddenly pops straight. | Finger locked in a bent position. | Trigger finger can affect any finger, including the thumb.

Aortic valve stenosis,"Aortic valve stenosis is a type of heart valve disease, also called valvular heart disease. The aortic valve is between the lower left heart chamber and the body's main artery, called the aorta. In aortic valve stenosis, the valve is narrowed and doesn't open fully. This reduces or blocks blood flow from the heart to the aorta and to the rest of the body.
Treatment of aortic stenosis depends on how severe the condition is. Treatment may include surgery to fix or replace the valve. Without treatment, severe aortic valve stenosis can lead to life-threatening complications.","Aortic valve stenosis ranges from mild to severe. Symptoms generally happen when the valve is very narrowed. Some people with aortic valve stenosis may not have symptoms for many years. | Symptoms of aortic valve stenosis may include: | Chest pain or tightness with activity. | Feeling faint or dizzy or fainting with activity. | Shortness of breath, especially with activity. | Fatigue, especially during times of increased activity. | Rapid, fluttering heartbeat. | Children with aortic valve stenosis may have other symptoms such as: | Not eating enough. | Not gaining enough weight. | Aortic valve stenosis may lead to heart failure. Heart failure symptoms include extreme tiredness, shortness of breath, and swollen ankles and feet.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aortic-stenosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353139
Mitral valve stenosis,"Mitral valve stenosis — sometimes called mitral stenosis — is a narrowing of the valve between the two left heart chambers. The narrowed valve reduces or blocks blood flow into the lower left heart chamber. The lower left heart chamber is the heart's main pumping chamber. It also is called the left ventricle.
Mitral valve stenosis can make you tired and short of breath. Other symptoms may include irregular heartbeats, dizziness, chest pain or coughing up blood. Some people don't notice symptoms.
Mitral valve stenosis can be caused by a complication of strep throat called rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever is now rare in the United States.
Treatment for mitral valve stenosis may include medicine or mitral valve repair or replacement surgery. Some people only need regular health checkups. Treatment depends on how severe the valve disease is and whether it's getting worse. Untreated, mitral valve stenosis can lead to serious heart complications.","Mitral valve stenosis usually worsens slowly. You may not have any symptoms, or you may have mild ones for many years. Symptoms of mitral valve stenosis can occur at any age, even during childhood. | Symptoms of mitral valve stenosis include: | Shortness of breath, especially with activity or when you lie down. | Fatigue, especially during increased activity. | Swollen feet or legs. | Pounding, skipping or otherwise irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias. | Dizziness or fainting. | Fluid buildup in the lungs. | Chest discomfort or chest pain. | Coughing up blood. | Mitral valve stenosis symptoms may appear or get worse when the heart rate increases, such as during exercise.

Pyloric stenosis,"Pyloric stenosis (pie-LOHR-ik stuh-NOH-sis) is a narrowing of the opening between the stomach and the small intestine. This uncommon condition in infants can trap food in the stomach.
Typically, a ring-shaped muscular valve closes to hold food in the stomach or opens to allow food to pass into the small intestine. With pyloric stenosis, the muscle tissue is enlarged. The opening becomes very narrow, and little to no food passes into the intestine.
Pyloric stenosis usually leads to forceful vomiting, dehydration, poor nutrition and weight loss. Babies with pyloric stenosis may seem to be hungry all the time.
Pyloric stenosis is treated with surgery.
The passage between the stomach and small intestine is called the pylorus. The valve that controls the opening may be called the pyloric muscle, pyloric sphincter or pyloric valve.
The enlargement of the pyloric muscle is called hypertrophy. Pyloric stenosis also is called hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.","Symptoms of pyloric stenosis usually appear within 3 to 6 weeks after birth. Pyloric stenosis is rare in babies older than 3 months. | Symptoms include: | Vomiting after feeding.The baby may vomit forcefully, ejecting breast milk or formula up to several feet away. This is known as projectile vomiting. Vomiting usually happens right after feeding. Vomiting might be mild at first and worsen over time. | Constant hunger.Babies who have pyloric stenosis often want to eat soon after vomiting. | Stomach contractions.Wavelike ripples across your baby's belly may be visible after feeding but before vomiting. This is a sign of the stomach muscles trying to move food out of the stomach. | Dehydration.A baby may show signs of low body fluids, also called dehydration. These signs may include few wet diapers, lack of energy, dry mouth and lips, and crying without tears. | Changes in stool.Since pyloric stenosis prevents food from reaching the intestines, babies with this condition might be constipated. | Weight loss.The lack of nutrition can cause a baby not to gain weight or to lose weight.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pyloric-stenosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351416
Bee sting,"A bee sting is a common outdoor nuisance. You can take several steps to avoid stings from bees, hornets and wasps. If you're stung, basic first aid can help ease the pain of a mild or moderate reaction. You may need emergency medical help for a severe reaction.","Bee sting symptoms can range from pain and swelling to a life-threatening allergic reaction. Having one type of reaction doesn't mean you'll always have the same reaction every time you're stung or that the next reaction will be more severe. | Mild reaction.Most of the time, bee sting symptoms are minor and include instant, sharp burning pain, a welt and swelling. In most people, the swelling and pain go away within a few hours. | Moderate reaction.Some people who get stung by a bee or other insect have a stronger reaction, with burning pain, a welt, itching, flushing and swelling that gets worse over the next day or two. The symptoms can last up to seven days. | Severe reaction.A severe reaction to a bee sting is potentially life-threatening and requires emergency treatment. This type of reaction is called anaphylaxis. A small percentage of people who are stung by a bee or other insect develop anaphylaxis. It usually happens 15 minutes to an hour after the sting. Symptoms include rash, itching, trouble breathing, swollen tongue, trouble swallowing and tightness in the chest. | Multiple bee stings.If you get stung more than a dozen times, you can have a bad reaction that makes you feel quite sick. Symptoms include those of a moderate reaction as well as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever and lightheadedness.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bee-stings/symptoms-causes/syc-20353869
Jellyfish stings,"Jellyfish stings are fairly common problems for people swimming, wading or diving in oceans. The long tentacles trailing from the jellyfish can inject venom from thousands of microscopic barbed stingers.
Most often jellyfish stings cause instant pain and inflamed marks on the skin. Some stings may cause more whole-body (systemic) illness. And in rare cases they're life-threatening.
Most jellyfish stings get better over a few days or weeks with home treatment. Severe reactions likely need emergency medical care.","Symptoms of jellyfish stings include: | Burning, prickling, stinging pain | Welts or tracks on the skin — a ""print"" of the tentacles' contact with the skin | Itchiness (pruritus) | Swelling | Throbbing pain that radiates up a leg or an arm | Severe jellyfish stings can affect multiple body systems. These reactions may appear rapidly or several hours after the stings. Symptoms of severe jellyfish stings include: | Stomach pain, nausea and vomiting | Headache | Muscle pain or spasms | Faintness, dizziness or confusion | Difficulty breathing | Heart problems | The severity of a reaction depends on: | The type and size of the jellyfish | The age, size and health of the person affected, with severe reactions more likely in children | How long the person was exposed to the stingers | How much of the skin is affected",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/jellyfish-stings/symptoms-causes/syc-20353284
Stomach cancer,"Stomach cancer, which is also called gastric cancer, is a growth of cells that starts in the stomach. The stomach is in the upper middle part of the belly, just below the ribs. The stomach helps to break down and digest food.
Stomach cancer can happen in any part of the stomach. In most of the world, stomach cancers happen in the main part of the stomach. This part is called the stomach body.
In the United States, stomach cancer is more likely to start by the gastroesophageal junction. This is the part where the long tube that carries food you swallow meets the stomach. The tube that carries food to the stomach is called the esophagus.
Where the cancer starts in the stomach is one factor health care providers think about when making a treatment plan. Other factors might include the cancer's stage and the type of cells involved. Treatment often includes surgery to remove the stomach cancer. Other treatments may be used before and after surgery.
Stomach cancer treatment is most likely to be successful if the cancer is only in the stomach. The prognosis for people with small stomach cancers is quite good. Many can expect to be cured. Most stomach cancers are found when the disease is advanced and a cure is less likely. Stomach cancer that grows through the stomach wall or spreads to other parts of the body is harder to cure.","Signs and symptoms of stomach cancer may include: | Trouble swallowing | Belly pain | Feeling bloated after eating | Feeling full after eating small amounts of food | Not feeling hungry when you would expect to be hungry | Heartburn | Indigestion | Nausea | Vomiting | Losing weight without trying | Feeling very tired | Stools that look black | Stomach cancer doesn't always cause symptoms in its early stages. When they happen, symptoms might include indigestion and pain in the upper part of the belly. Symptoms might not happen until the cancer is advanced. Later stages of stomach cancer might cause symptoms such as feeling very tired, losing weight without trying, vomiting blood and having black stools. | Stomach cancer that spreads to other parts of the body is called metastatic stomach cancer. It causes symptoms specific to where it spreads. For example, when cancer spreads to the lymph nodes it might cause lumps you can feel through the skin. Cancer that spreads to the liver might cause yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes. If cancer spreads within the belly, it might cause fluid to fill the belly. The belly might look swollen.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stomach-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352438

Hemangioma,"A hemangioma (he-man-jee-O-muh), also known as an infantile hemangioma or hemangioma of infancy, is a bright red birthmark. It looks like a rubbery bump or flat red patch and is made up of extra blood vessels in the skin. The mark shows up at birth or in the first month of life.
A hemangioma typically appears on the face, scalp, chest or back, though it can be anywhere on the skin. Treatment generally isn't needed for a baby's hemangioma, as the mark fades over time. Typically, there is little trace of it by age 10. You may want to think about treatment for the child if a hemangioma leads to problems with vision, breathing or other bodily functions. You also may think about treatment if the hemangioma is in a cosmetically sensitive area.","A hemangioma may be visible at birth, but it appears more often during the first month of life. It starts as a flat red mark on the body, most often on the face, scalp, chest or back. A child generally only has one mark, but some children may have more than one mark. | During your child's first year, the red mark may grow rapidly into a spongy, rubbery-looking bump that sticks out from the skin. The hemangioma then enters a rest phase. Then it will begin to slowly go away. | Many hemangiomas go away by age 5, and most go away by age 10.

Broken heart syndrome,"Broken heart syndrome is a heart condition that's often brought on by stressful situations and extreme emotions. The condition also can be triggered by a serious physical illness or surgery. Broken heart syndrome is usually temporary. But some people may continue to feel unwell after the heart is healed.
People with broken heart syndrome may have sudden chest pain or think they're having a heart attack. Broken heart syndrome affects just part of the heart. It briefly interrupts the way the heart pumps blood. The rest of the heart continues to work as usual. Sometimes the heart contracts more forcefully.
Medicines are used to treat symptoms of broken heart syndrome.
Broken heart syndrome also may be called:",Symptoms of broken heart syndrome can mimic those of a heart attack. Symptoms may include: | Chest pain. | Shortness of breath.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-heart-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20354617

Stress incontinence,"Urinary incontinence is the loss of bladder control. Stress incontinence happens when movement or activity puts pressure on the bladder, causing urine to leak. Movements include coughing, laughing, sneezing, running or heavy lifting. Stress incontinence is not related to mental stress.
Stress incontinence is not the same as urgency incontinence and overactive bladder (OAB). Those conditions cause the bladder muscle to spasm. This leads to a sudden need to urinate quickly. Stress incontinence is much more common in women than in men.
If you have stress incontinence, you may feel ashamed. You might limit your work and social life because you don't want to be with others. You also might not do physical or fun activities.
Treatment can help you manage stress incontinence and improve your quality of life.","If you have stress incontinence, you may leak urine when you: | Cough or sneeze. | Laugh. | Bend over. | Lift something heavy. | Exercise. | Have sex. | You might not leak urine every time you do one of these things. But any activity that puts pressure on your bladder can make leaking more likely. Having a full bladder increases the chances of leaking.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stress-incontinence/symptoms-causes/syc-20355727

Stroke,"An ischemic stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is blocked or reduced. This prevents brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients. Brain cells begin to die in minutes. Another type of stroke is a hemorrhagic stroke. It occurs when a blood vessel in the brain leaks or bursts and causes bleeding in the brain. The blood increases pressure on brain cells and damages them.
A stroke is a medical emergency. It's crucial to get medical treatment right away. Getting emergency medical help quickly can reduce brain damage and other stroke complications.
The good news is that fewer Americans die of stroke now than in the past. Effective treatments also can help prevent disability from stroke.","If you or someone you're with may be having a stroke, pay attention to the time the symptoms began. Some treatments are most effective when given soon after a stroke begins. | Symptoms of stroke include: | Trouble speaking and understanding what others are saying.A person having a stroke may be confused, slur words or may not be able to understand speech. | Numbness, weakness or paralysis in the face, arm or leg.This often affects just one side of the body. The person can try to raise both arms over the head. If one arm begins to fall, it may be a sign of a stroke. Also, one side of the mouth may droop when trying to smile. | Problems seeing in one or both eyes.The person may suddenly have blurred or blackened vision in one or both eyes. Or the person may see double. | Headache.A sudden, severe headache may be a symptom of a stroke.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage,"A subarachnoid hemorrhage is bleeding in the space between the brain and the tissues that cover the brain. The space is known as the subarachnoid space. A subarachnoid hemorrhage is a type of stroke. It is a medical emergency that needs treatment right away.
The primary symptom of a subarachnoid hemorrhage is a sudden, very bad headache. Some people describe it as the worst headache they have ever felt. A subarachnoid hemorrhage also may cause nausea, vomiting, a stiff neck and other symptoms.
Bleeding usually happens when an irregular bulge in a blood vessel, known as an aneurysm, bursts in the brain. Bleeding also can happen because of a head injury. Sometimes a tangle of blood vessels in the brain, known as an arteriovenous malformation, causes the bleeding. And other health conditions, including conditions that affect the blood vessels, can cause bleeding.
If a subarachnoid hemorrhage isn't treated, it can lead to permanent brain damage or death, so it's important to get treatment right away.","The most common symptom of a subarachnoid hemorrhage is a very sudden, very bad headache. The headache starts in a split second and becomes very painful right away.

Infertility may happen because of a health issue with either you or your partner, or a mix of factors that prevent pregnancy. But many safe and effective treatments can boost your chances of getting pregnant.","The main symptom of infertility is not getting pregnant. There may be no other clear symptoms. Some women with infertility may have irregular menstrual periods or no periods.

Drug addiction (substance use disorder),"Drug addiction, also called substance use disorder, is a disease that affects a person's brain and behavior and leads to an inability to control the use of a legal or illegal drug or medicine. Substances such as alcohol, marijuana and nicotine also are considered drugs. When you're addicted, you may continue using the drug despite the harm it causes.
Drug addiction can start with experimental use of a recreational drug in social situations, and, for some people, the drug use becomes more frequent. For others, particularly with opioids, drug addiction begins when they take prescribed medicines or receive them from others who have prescriptions.
The risk of addiction and how fast you become addicted varies by drug. Some drugs, such as opioid painkillers, have a higher risk and cause addiction more quickly than others.
As time passes, you may need larger doses of the drug to get high. Soon you may need the drug just to feel good. As your drug use increases, you may find that it's increasingly difficult to go without the drug. Attempts to stop drug use may cause intense cravings and make you feel physically ill. These are called withdrawal symptoms.
Help from your health care provider, family, friends, support groups or an organized treatment program can help you overcome your drug addiction and stay drug-free.","Drug addiction symptoms or behaviors include, among others: | Feeling that you have to use the drug regularly — daily or even several times a day | Having intense urges for the drug that block out any other thoughts | Over time, needing more of the drug to get the same effect | Taking larger amounts of the drug over a longer period of time than you intended | Making certain that you maintain a supply of the drug | Spending money on the drug, even though you can't afford it | Not meeting obligations and work responsibilities, or cutting back on social or recreational activities because of drug use | Continuing to use the drug, even though you know it's causing problems in your life or causing you physical or psychological harm | Doing things to get the drug that you normally wouldn't do, such as stealing | Driving or doing other risky activities when you're under the influence of the drug | Spending a good deal of time getting the drug, using the drug or recovering from the effects of the drug | Failing in your attempts to stop using the drug | Experiencing withdrawal symptoms when you attempt to stop taking the drug",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/drug-addiction/symptoms-causes/syc-20365112
Sudden cardiac arrest,"Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the sudden loss of all heart activity due to an irregular heart rhythm. Breathing stops. The person becomes unconscious. Without immediate treatment, sudden cardiac arrest can lead to death.
Emergency treatment for sudden cardiac arrest includes cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and shocks to the heart with a device called an automated external defibrillator (AED). Survival is possible with fast, appropriate medical care.
Sudden cardiac arrest isn't the same as a heart attack. A heart attack happens when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked. Sudden cardiac arrest is not due to a blockage. However, a heart attack can cause a change in the heart's electrical activity that leads to sudden cardiac arrest.","Symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest are immediate and severe and include: | Sudden collapse. | No pulse. | No breathing. | Loss of consciousness. | Sometimes other symptoms occur before sudden cardiac arrest. These might include: | Chest discomfort. | Shortness of breath. | Weakness. | Fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heartbeat called palpitations. | But sudden cardiac arrest often occurs with no warning.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sudden-cardiac-arrest/symptoms-causes/syc-20350634

Sun allergy,"Sun allergy is a broad term. It describes several conditions that cause an itchy rash to form on the skin after being in sunlight or other sources of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Polymorphous light eruption is the most common form of sun allergy.
Some people have a hereditary type of sun allergy. Others develop symptoms only when triggered by another factor — such as taking medication or touching certain plants. Other types of sun-related reactions occur for reasons that are unclear.
Mild sun allergy may clear up without treatment. Severe rashes may be treated with steroid creams or pills. If you have severe sun allergy, you may need to take preventive steps. For example, wear clothing that shields you from the sun.",How skin with sun allergy looks varies widely depending on the color of your skin and what's causing the symptoms. Signs and symptoms may include: | Itchiness (pruritus) | Stinging | Tiny bumps that may merge into raised patches | A flushing of the exposed area | Blisters or hives | Symptoms usually occur only on skin that has been exposed to the sun or other source ofUVlight.

Sunburn,"Sunburn is inflamed, painful skin that feels hot to the touch. It often appears within a few hours of being in the sun too long.
You can get sunburn relief with simple self-care measures such as taking pain relievers and cooling the skin. But it may take days for the sunburn to fade.
Preventing sunburn year-round by wearing sunscreen or using other skin-protection habits is important for everyone. It is especially important when you're outdoors, even on cool or cloudy days.","Sunburn symptoms can include: | Inflamed skin, which looks pink or red on white skin and may be harder to see on brown or Black skin. | Skin that feels warm or hot to the touch. | Pain, tenderness and itching. | Swelling. | Small, fluid-filled blisters, which may break. | Headache, fever, nausea and fatigue, if the sunburn is severe. | Eyes that feel painful or gritty. | Any exposed part of the body — including the earlobes, scalp and lips — can burn. Even covered areas can burn if, for example, clothing has a loose weave that allows ultraviolet (UV) light through. The eyes, which are extremely sensitive to the sun's UV light, also can burn. | Sunburn symptoms often appear within a few hours after sun exposure. | Within a few days, the body may start to heal itself by peeling the damaged skin's top layer.

Pectus excavatum,"Pectus excavatum is a condition in which the breastbone is sunken into the chest. The sunken breastbone often can be seen shortly after birth. If the breastbone sinks a lot over time, the center of the chest may look like it's been scooped out. This change leaves a deep dent or dip. But many people with the condition just have a slight dip in the breastbone.
This condition also is known as funnel chest. But it can affect much more than the look of the chest. It also can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, and a fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart. The symptoms tend to become worse during the teenage growth spurt.
The exact cause of pectus excavatum isn't clear. When the condition is serious, it can affect how well the heart and lungs work over time. But even mild pectus excavatum that causes a slight dip in the breastbone can make children feel self-conscious about their bodies.
Surgery to repair pectus excavatum can improve symptoms and the appearance of the chest. But surgery isn't right for everyone with the condition. Other treatment choices may include physical therapy and medical devices.","For many people with pectus excavatum, the only symptom is a slight dip in their chests. In some children, the dip becomes deeper during early puberty. It can keep getting deeper into adulthood. | In people with pectus excavatum, the breastbone may compress the lungs and heart. Symptoms can include: | A fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart. | Chest pain. | Loss of endurance that becomes worse over time. | Shortness of breath or extreme tiredness during physical activity. | A high-pitched whistling sound made while breathing that's triggered by exercise. | Fainting or dizziness. | Frequent infections of the upper airway. | Stress and concern about how the chest looks.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pectus-excavatum/symptoms-causes/syc-20355483
Supraventricular tachycardia,"Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a type of irregular heartbeat, also called an arrhythmia. It's a very fast or erratic heartbeat that affects the heart's upper chambers.SVTalso is called paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
The typical heart beats about 60 to 100 times a minute. DuringSVT, the heart beats about 150 to 220 times a minute. Occasionally it beats faster or slower.
Most people with supraventricular tachycardia don't need treatment. When recommended, treatment may include specific actions or movements, medicines, a heart procedure, or a device to control the heartbeat.","The main symptom of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a very fast heartbeat that may last for a few minutes to a few days. The heart beats 100 or more times a minute. Usually duringSVT, the heart beats 150 to 220 times a minute. The fast heartbeat may come and go suddenly. | Symptoms of supraventricular tachycardia may include: | Pounding or fluttering feelings in the chest, called palpitations. | A pounding sensation in the neck. | Chest pain. | Fainting or almost fainting. | Lightheadedness or dizziness. | Shortness of breath. | Sweating. | Weakness or extreme tiredness. | Some people withSVTdo not notice symptoms. | In infants and very young children, symptoms ofSVTmay be vague.

Hyperhidrosis treatment usually helps. It often begins with antiperspirants. If these don't help, you may need to try different medications and therapies. In severe cases, your health care provider may suggest surgery to remove the sweat glands or to disconnect the nerves related to producing too much sweat.
Sometimes an underlying condition may be found and treated.","The main symptom of hyperhidrosis is heavy sweating. This goes beyond the sweating from being in a hot environment, exercising, or feeling anxious or stressed.

Craniosynostosis,"Craniosynostosis (kray-nee-o-sin-os-TOE-sis) is a disorder present at birth in which one or more of the fibrous joints between the bones of your baby's skull (cranial sutures) close prematurely (fuse), before your baby's brain is fully formed. Brain growth continues, giving the head a misshapen appearance.
Usually, during infancy the sutures remain flexible, allowing a baby's skull to expand as the brain grows. In the front of the skull, the sutures meet in the large soft spot (fontanel) on top of the head. The anterior fontanel is the soft spot felt just behind a baby's forehead. The next largest fontanel is at the back (posterior). Each side of the skull has a tiny fontanel.
Craniosynostosis usually involves premature fusion of a single cranial suture, but it can involve more than one of the sutures in a baby's skull (multiple suture craniosynostosis). In rare cases, craniosynostosis is caused by certain genetic syndromes (syndromic craniosynostosis).
Treating craniosynostosis involves surgery to correct the shape of the head and allow for brain growth. Early diagnosis and treatment allow your baby's brain adequate space to grow and develop.
Although neurological damage can occur in severe cases, most children develop as expected in their ability to think and reason (cognitive development) and have good cosmetic results after surgery. Early diagnosis and treatment are key.","The signs of craniosynostosis are usually noticeable at birth, but they become more apparent during the first few months of your baby's life. Signs and severity depend on how many sutures are fused and when in brain development the fusion occurs. Signs and symptoms can include: | A misshapen skull, with the shape depending on which of the sutures are affected | Development of a raised, hard ridge along affected sutures, with a change in the shape of the head that's not typical",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/craniosynostosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354513
Synovial sarcoma,"Synovial sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that tends to occur near large joints, mainly the knees. Synovial sarcoma usually affects young adults.
Synovial sarcoma begins as a growth of cells that can multiply quickly and destroy healthy tissue. The first symptom is usually swelling or a lump under the skin. The lump may or may not hurt.
Synovial sarcoma can occur almost anywhere in the body. The most common places are in the legs and arms.
Synovial sarcoma is a type of cancer called a soft tissue sarcoma. Soft tissue sarcoma happens in the body's connective tissues. There are many types of soft tissue sarcoma.","Signs and symptoms of synovial sarcoma depend on where the cancer starts. Most people notice a painless lump or bump that slowly gets bigger. The lump usually starts near the knee or ankle, but it can appear on any part of the body. | Synovial sarcoma symptoms may include: | A lump or bump under the skin that slowly gets bigger. | Joint stiffness. | Pain. | Swelling. | Synovial sarcoma that happens in the head or neck can cause other symptoms. These may include: | Problems breathing. | Difficulty swallowing. | Changes in the way the voice sounds.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/synovial-sarcoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20577380
Syphilis,"Syphilis is an infection caused by bacteria. Most often, it spreads through sexual contact. The disease starts as a sore that's often painless and typically appears on the genitals, rectum or mouth. Syphilis spreads from person to person through direct contact with these sores. It also can be passed to a baby during pregnancy and childbirth and sometimes through breastfeeding.
After the infection happens, syphilis bacteria can stay in the body for many years without causing symptoms. But the infection can become active again. Without treatment, syphilis can damage the heart, brain or other organs. It can become life-threatening.
Early syphilis can be cured, sometimes with a single shot of medicine called penicillin. That's why it's key to get a health care checkup as soon as you notice any symptoms of syphilis. All pregnant people should get tested for syphilis at their first prenatal checkup too.",Syphilis develops in stages. The symptoms vary with each stage. But the stages may overlap. And the symptoms don't always happen in the same order. You may be infected with syphilis bacteria without noticing any symptoms for years.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/syphilis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351756
Syringomyelia,"Syringomyelia (sih-ring-go-my-E-lee-uh) is the development of a fluid-filled cyst within the spinal cord. The cyst, which is sometimes called a syrinx, can grow larger over time. When it does, it can damage the spinal cord and cause pain, weakness and stiffness.
Syringomyelia has several possible causes. Many cases are associated with a Chiari malformation. This is a condition in which brain tissue pushes into the spinal canal.
Other causes of syringomyelia include spinal cord tumors, spinal cord injuries and damage caused by swelling around the spinal cord.
If syringomyelia doesn't cause problems, monitoring the condition might be all that's necessary. But if the symptoms are bothersome, surgery might be needed.","Syringomyelia symptoms usually develop slowly over time. If syringomyelia is caused by brain tissue pushing into the spinal canal, it is called a Chiari malformation. Symptoms generally begin between ages 25 and 40. | In some cases, coughing or straining can trigger symptoms of syringomyelia, although neither causes syringomyelia. | Syringomyelia might affect the back, shoulders, arms or legs. Symptoms can include: | Muscle weakness and muscle wasting. | Loss of reflexes. | Loss of sensitivity to pain and temperature. | Headaches. | Stiffness in the back, shoulders, arms and legs. | Pain in the neck, arms and back. | Scoliosis. This is when the spine curves sideways.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/syringomyelia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354771

Systemic mastocytosis,"Systemic mastocytosis (mas-to-sy-TOE-sis) is a rare disorder that results in too many mast cells building up in your body. A mast cell is a type of white blood cell. Mast cells are found in connective tissues throughout your body. Mast cells help your immune system function properly and normally help protect you from disease.
When you have systemic mastocytosis, excess mast cells build up in your skin, bone marrow, digestive tract or other body organs. When triggered, these mast cells release substances that can cause signs and symptoms similar to those of an allergic reaction and, sometimes, severe inflammation that may result in organ damage. Common triggers include alcohol, spicy foods, insect stings and certain medications.","Signs and symptoms of systemic mastocytosis depend on the part of the body affected by excessive mast cells. Too many mast cells can build up in the skin, liver, spleen, bone marrow or intestines. Less commonly, other organs such as the brain, heart or lungs also may be affected. | Signs and symptoms of systemic mastocytosis may include: | Flushing, itching or hives | Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting | Anemia or bleeding disorders | Bone and muscle pain | Enlarged liver, spleen or lymph nodes | Depression, mood changes or problems concentrating | The mast cells are triggered to produce substances that cause inflammation and symptoms. People have different triggers, but the most common ones include: | Alcohol | Skin irritation | Spicy foods | Exercise | Insect stings | Certain medications | When to see a doctor | Talk to your doctor if you have problems with flushing or hives, or if you have concerns about the signs or symptoms listed above.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/systemic-mastocytosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352859
Tachycardia,"Tachycardia (tak-ih-KAHR-dee-uh) is the medical term for a heart rate over 100 beats a minute. Many types of irregular heart rhythms, called arrhythmias, can cause tachycardia.
A fast heart rate isn't always a concern. For instance, the heart rate usually rises during exercise or as a response to stress.
Tachycardia may not cause any symptoms or complications. But sometimes it's a warning of a medical condition that needs attention. Some forms of tachycardia can lead to serious health problems if left untreated. Such problems may include heart failure, stroke or sudden cardiac death.
Treatment for tachycardia may include specific actions or movements, medicine, cardioversion, or surgery to control a rapid heartbeat.","Some people with tachycardia have no symptoms. The fast heartbeat may be discovered when a physical exam or heart tests are done for another reason. | In general, tachycardia may cause these symptoms: | Racing, pounding heartbeat or flopping in the chest, called palpitations. | Chest pain. | Fainting. | Lightheadedness. | Rapid pulse. | Shortness of breath.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tachycardia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355127

Broken heart syndrome,"Broken heart syndrome is a heart condition that's often brought on by stressful situations and extreme emotions. The condition also can be triggered by a serious physical illness or surgery. Broken heart syndrome is usually temporary. But some people may continue to feel unwell after the heart is healed.
People with broken heart syndrome may have sudden chest pain or think they're having a heart attack. Broken heart syndrome affects just part of the heart. It briefly interrupts the way the heart pumps blood. The rest of the heart continues to work as usual. Sometimes the heart contracts more forcefully.
Medicines are used to treat symptoms of broken heart syndrome.
Broken heart syndrome also may be called:",Symptoms of broken heart syndrome can mimic those of a heart attack. Symptoms may include: | Chest pain. | Shortness of breath.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-heart-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20354617
Tapeworm infection,"A tapeworm is a parasite that can live and feed in human intestines. This is called a tapeworm infection.
A young and inactive form of the tapeworm is called a larval cyst. It can stay alive in other parts of the body. This is called a larval cyst infection.
A tapeworm in the intestines often causes mild symptoms. Moderate to severe symptoms may include stomach pain and diarrhea. Larval cysts can cause serious disease if they are in a person's brain, liver, lungs, heart or eyes.
Tapeworm infections are treated with anti-parasitic drugs. Treatments for larval cyst infections may include anti-parasitic drugs and surgery to remove the cyst. Other drugs may be used to treat symptoms.",Symptoms depend mostly on where the infection happens in the body.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tapeworm/symptoms-causes/syc-20378174
Tay-Sachs disease,"Tay-Sachs disease is a rare genetic disorder passed from parents to child. It's caused by the absence of an enzyme that helps break down fatty substances. These fatty substances, called gangliosides, build up to toxic levels in the brain and spinal cord and affect the function of the nerve cells.
In the most common and severe form of Tay-Sachs disease, signs and symptoms start to show up at about 3 to 6 months of age. As the disease progresses, development slows and muscles begin to weaken. Over time, this leads to seizures, vision and hearing loss, paralysis, and other major issues. Children with this form of Tay-Sachs disease typically live only a few years.
Less commonly, some children have the juvenile form of Tay-Sachs disease and may live into their teen years. Rarely, some adults have a late-onset form of Tay-Sachs disease which is often less severe than forms that begin in childhood.
If you have a family history of Tay-Sachs disease or if you're a member of a high-risk group and plan to have children, health care providers strongly recommend genetic testing and genetic counseling.","There are three forms of Tay-Sachs disease: infantile, juvenile and late onset/adult.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tay-sachs-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20378190

Teen depression,"Teen depression is a serious mental health problem that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest in activities. It affects how your teenager thinks, feels and behaves, and it can cause emotional, functional and physical problems. Although depression can occur at any time in life, symptoms may be different between teens and adults.
Issues such as peer pressure, academic expectations and changing bodies can bring a lot of ups and downs for teens. But for some teens, the lows are more than just temporary feelings — they're a symptom of depression.
Teen depression isn't a weakness or something that can be overcome with willpower — it can have serious consequences and requires long-term treatment. For most teens, depression symptoms ease with treatment such as medication and psychological counseling.","Teen depression signs and symptoms include a change from the teenager's previous attitude and behavior that can cause significant distress and problems at school or home, in social activities, or in other areas of life. | Depression symptoms can vary in severity, but changes in your teen's emotions and behavior may include the examples below.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/teen-depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20350985
Teeth grinding (bruxism),"The medical term for teeth grinding is bruxism (BRUK-siz-um), a condition in which you squeeze or rub your teeth together, also called clenching or grinding. Bruxism is common and can happen during the day or night. If you have awake bruxism, you clench or grind your teeth when you're awake without being aware that you're doing it. If you have sleep bruxism, you clench or grind your teeth during sleep. Sleep bruxism is a sleep-related movement disorder.
People who clench or grind their teeth during sleep are more likely to have other sleep disorders, such as snoring and pauses in breathing called sleep apnea. Some people may not know they have sleep bruxism until they have tooth or jaw problems because of it.
In some people, bruxism can be a problem and happen often enough to lead to jaw pain, headaches, damaged teeth and other problems. The grinding sound can disrupt a bed partner's sleep. Learn the symptoms of bruxism and get regular dental care to check your teeth.","Symptoms of bruxism may include: | Teeth grinding or clenching, which may be loud enough to wake up your sleep partner. | Teeth that are flattened, fractured, chipped or loose. | Worn tooth enamel. This can expose the inner layers of your teeth. | Tooth pain or sensitivity. | Tired or tight jaw muscles, or a locked jaw that won't open or close all the way. Your jaw may pop and click. | Jaw, neck or face pain or soreness. | Jaw muscles that are larger than expected. | Pain that feels like an earache, though it's not really a problem with your ear. | Dull headache starting at your temples — the sides of your head between your forehead and ears. | Sleep problems. | See your dentist or other healthcare professional if you have symptoms that could be caused by grinding or clenching your teeth or if you have other concerns about your teeth or jaws. | If you notice that your child has symptoms of teeth grinding, be sure to mention it at your child's next dental appointment.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bruxism/symptoms-causes/syc-20356095
Giant cell arteritis,"Giant cell arteritis is an inflammation of the lining of your arteries. Most often, it affects the arteries in your head, especially those in your temples. For this reason, giant cell arteritis is sometimes called temporal arteritis.
Giant cell arteritis frequently causes headaches, scalp tenderness, jaw pain and vision problems. Untreated, it can lead to blindness.
Prompt treatment with corticosteroid medications usually relieves symptoms of giant cell arteritis and might prevent loss of vision. You'll likely begin to feel better within days of starting treatment. But even with treatment, relapses are common.
You'll need to visit your doctor regularly for checkups and treatment of any side effects from taking corticosteroids.","The most common symptoms of giant cell arteritis are head pain and tenderness — often severe — that usually affects both temples. Head pain can progressively worsen, come and go, or subside temporarily. | Generally, signs and symptoms of giant cell arteritis include: | Persistent, severe head pain, usually in your temple area | Scalp tenderness | Jaw pain when you chew or open your mouth wide | Fever | Fatigue | Unintended weight loss | Vision loss or double vision, particularly in people who also have jaw pain | Sudden, permanent loss of vision in one eye | Pain and stiffness in the neck, shoulders or hips are common symptoms of a related disorder, polymyalgia rheumatica. About 50 percent of people with giant cell arteritis also have polymyalgia rheumatica.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/giant-cell-arteritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20372758
Temporal lobe seizure,"Temporal lobe seizures begin in the temporal lobes of the brain. These areas process emotions and are important for short-term memory. Symptoms of a temporal lobe seizure often affect these functions . Some people have odd feelings during the seizure, such as joy, deja vu or fear.
Temporal lobe seizures are sometimes called focal seizures with impaired awareness. Some people are aware of what's going on during the seizure. People who have more-intense seizures might look awake but won't respond to what's around them. Their lips and hands may make motions over and over.
The cause of temporal lobe seizures often isn't known. But it may stem from a scar in the temporal lobe. Temporal lobe seizures are treated with medicine. Some people who don't respond to medicine may have surgery.","An odd feeling called an aura may happen before a temporal lobe seizure. An aura acts as a warning. Not everyone who has temporal lobe seizures has auras. And not everyone who has auras remembers them. | The aura is the first part of a focal seizure before a loss of consciousness. | Examples of auras include: | A sudden sense of fear or joy. | A feeling that what's happening has happened before, known as deja vu. | A sudden or strange odor or taste. | A rising feeling in the belly that feels like being on a roller coaster | Sometimes temporal lobe seizures keep people from responding to others. This type of temporal lobe seizure most often lasts 30 seconds to 2 minutes. | Symptoms of a temporal lobe seizure include: | Not being aware of the people and things around you. | Staring. | Lip smacking. | Swallowing or chewing over and over. | Finger movements, such as picking motions. | After a temporal lobe seizure, you may: | Be confused and have trouble speaking for a time. | Be unable to recall what happened during the seizure. | Be unaware of having had a seizure. | Be very sleepy. | Sometimes, what starts as a temporal lobe seizure becomes a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. This type of seizure causes shaking, known as convulsions, and loss of consciousness. It also is called a grand mal seizure.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/temporal-lobe-seizure/symptoms-causes/syc-20378214
TMJ disorders,"The temporomandibular (tem-puh-roe-man-DIB-u-lur) joint, also called TMJ, acts like a sliding hinge. It connects the jawbone to the skull. There is one joint on each side of the jaw. TMJ disorders — a type of temporomandibular disorder or TMD — can cause pain in the jaw joint and in the muscles that control jaw movement.
The exact cause of TMJ disorder is often hard to determine. The pain may be due to a mix of factors, including habits such as teeth clenching, gum chewing and nail biting; stress; and painful conditions that occur along with TMJ disorder such as fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis or jaw injury. The habit of teeth clenching or grinding also is known as bruxism.
Most of the time, the pain and discomfort related to TMJ disorders lasts for only a limited time. Self-managed home care, physical therapy for the jaw and the use of a mouth guard can be effective in treating symptoms of TMJ disorder. Surgery is usually a last resort after conservative measures have failed. But surgical treatments may help some people with TMJ disorders.","Symptoms of TMJ disorders may include: | Pain or tenderness in the jaw. | Pain in one or both temporomandibular joints. | Aching pain in and around the ear. | Having a hard time chewing or pain while chewing. | Aching facial pain. | Locking of the joint, making it hard to open or close your mouth. | Headache. | Neck pain. | Eye pain. | Tooth pain that occurs along with jaw tenderness. | TMJ disorders also can cause a clicking sound or grating sensation when you open your mouth or chew. But if there's no pain or limitation of movement related to your jaw clicking, it's likely that you won't need treatment.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tmj/symptoms-causes/syc-20350941
TEN,"Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare, life-threatening skin reaction, usually caused by a medication. It's a severe form of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). In people withSJS,TENis diagnosed when more than 30% of the skin surface is affected and the moist linings of the body (mucous membranes) have extensive damage.
TENis a life-threatening condition that affects people of all ages.TENis usually treated in a hospital. While the skin heals, supportive care includes controlling pain, caring for wounds and making sure you're getting enough fluids. Recovery can take weeks to months.
If your condition was caused by a medication, you'll need to permanently avoid that drug and those related to it.","Toxic epidermal necrolysis signs and symptoms include: | Widespread skin pain | A spreading rash covering more than 30% of the body | Blisters and large areas of peeling skin | Sores, swelling and crusting on the mucous membranes, including the mouth, eyes and vagina",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/toxic-epidermal-necrolysis/symptoms-causes/syc-20491903
Tendinitis,"Tendinitis is inflammation of the thick fibrous cords that attach muscle to bone. These cords are called tendons. The condition causes pain and tenderness just outside a joint.
Tendinitis can occur in any tendon. But it's most common around shoulders, elbows, wrists, knees and heels.
Most tendinitis can be treated with rest, physical therapy and medicine to reduce pain. Long-lasting tendon inflammation can cause a tendon to tear. A torn tendon might need surgery.","Symptoms of tendinitis tend to occur where a tendon attaches to a bone.

Tennis elbow,"Tennis elbow, also known as lateral epicondylitis, is a condition that can result from overuse of the muscles and tendons in the elbow. Tennis elbow is often linked to repeated motions of the wrist and arm.
Despite its name, most people who get tennis elbow don't play tennis. Some people have jobs that involve repeated movements that can lead to tennis elbow. These include plumbers, painters, carpenters and butchers. However, often tennis elbow has no clear cause.
The pain of tennis elbow occurs mainly where the tough, cord-like tissues of the forearm muscles attach to a bony bump on the outside of the elbow. The tissues are known as tendons. Pain can spread into the forearm and wrist.
Rest, pain medicines and physical therapy often help relieve tennis elbow. People for whom these treatments don't help or who have symptoms that get in the way of daily living might have a procedure, such as a shot or surgery.",The pain of tennis elbow can travel from the outside of the elbow into the forearm and wrist. Pain and weakness can make it hard to: | Shake hands or grip an object. | Turn a doorknob. | Hold a coffee cup.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tennis-elbow/symptoms-causes/syc-20351987
De Quervain tenosynovitis,"De Quervain tenosynovitis (dih-kwer-VAIN ten-oh-sine-oh-VIE-tis) is a painful condition affecting the tendons on the thumb side of the wrist. If you have de Quervain tenosynovitis, you will probably feel pain when you turn your wrist, grasp anything or make a fist.
Although the exact cause of de Quervain tenosynovitis isn't known, any activity that relies on repetitive hand or wrist movement — such as working in the garden, playing golf or racket sports, or lifting a baby — can make it worse.","Symptoms of de Quervain tenosynovitis include: | Pain near the base of the thumb | Swelling near the base of the thumb | Difficulty moving the thumb and wrist when doing something that involves grasping or pinching | A ""sticking"" or ""stop-and-go"" sensation in the thumb when moving it | If the condition goes too long without treatment, the pain may spread farther into the thumb or forearm or both.

Tension headache,"A tension-type headache causes mild to moderate pain that's often described as feeling like a tight band around the head. A tension-type headache is the most common type of headache, yet its causes aren't well understood.
Treatments are available. Managing a tension-type headache is often a balance between practicing healthy habits, finding effective nonmedicine treatments and using medicines appropriately.","Symptoms of a tension-type headache include: | Dull, aching head pain. | Feeling of tightness or pressure across the forehead or on the sides and back of the head. | Tenderness in the scalp, neck and shoulder muscles. | Tension-type headaches are divided into two main categories — episodic and chronic.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tension-headache/symptoms-causes/syc-20353977
Retractile testicle,"A retractile testicle is a testicle that may move back and forth between the scrotum and the groin. When the retractile testicle is in the groin, it might be easily guided by hand into its proper position in the scrotum — the bag of skin hanging behind the penis — during a physical exam. Upon release, the testicle will remain in the proper position at least temporarily.
For most boys, the problem of a retractile testicle goes away sometime before or during puberty. The testicle moves to its correct location in the scrotum and stays there permanently.
Sometimes the retractile testicle remains in the groin and is no longer movable. When this happens, the condition is called an ascending testicle or an acquired undescended testicle.","Testicles form in the abdomen during fetal development. During the final months of development, the testicles gradually descend into the scrotum. If this descent isn't completed at birth, the testicle usually descends within a few months. If your son has a retractile testicle, the testicle originally descended as it should, but doesn't remain in place. | Symptoms of a retractile testicle include: | The testicle may be moved by hand from the groin into the scrotum and won't immediately retreat to the groin. | The testicle might spontaneously appear in the scrotum and remain there for a time. | The testicle might spontaneously disappear again for a time. | Retractile testicle is different from undescended testicle (cryptorchidism). An undescended testicle is one that never entered the scrotum.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/retractile-testicle/symptoms-causes/syc-20377197
Undescended testicle,"A testicle that doesn't move down into its proper place in the scrotum before birth is called an undescended testicle. It's also known as cryptorchidism (krip-TOR-kih-diz-um). Most often, it's just one testicle that doesn't descend into the scrotum, which is the bag of skin that hangs below the penis. But sometimes both testicles are affected.
An undescended testicle is more common in premature babies than it is in full-term infants. An undescended testicle often moves down on its own within a few months after the baby is born. If your baby has an undescended testicle that doesn't correct itself, surgery can be done to move the testicle into the scrotum.","Not seeing or feeling a testicle in the scrotum is the main symptom of an undescended testicle. | Testicles form in an unborn baby's lower belly. During the last few months of pregnancy, the testicles typically move down from the stomach area.

Testicular cancer,"Testicular cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the testicles. The testicles, which are also called testes, are in the scrotum. The scrotum is a loose bag of skin underneath the penis. The testicles make sperm and the hormone testosterone.
Testicular cancer isn't a common type of cancer. It can happen at any age, but it happens most often between the ages of 15 and 45.
The first sign of testicular cancer often is a bump or lump on a testicle. The cancer cells can grow quickly. They often spread outside the testicle to other parts of the body.
Testicular cancer is highly treatable, even when it spreads to other parts of the body. Treatments depend on the type of testicular cancer that you have and how far it has spread. Common treatments include surgery and chemotherapy.",Signs and symptoms of testicular cancer include: | A lump or swelling in either testicle | A feeling of heaviness in the scrotum | A dull ache in the lower belly or groin | Sudden swelling in the scrotum | Pain or discomfort in a testicle or the scrotum | Enlargement or tenderness of the breast tissue | Back pain | Usually testicular cancer only happens in one testicle.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/testicular-cancer-care/symptoms-causes/syc-20352986

Tetanus,"Tetanus is a serious disease of the nervous system caused by a toxin-producing bacterium. The disease causes muscle contractions, particularly of your jaw and neck muscles. Tetanus is commonly known as lockjaw.
Severe complications of tetanus can be life-threatening. There's no cure for tetanus. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and complications until the effects of the tetanus toxin resolve.
Because of the widespread use of vaccines, cases of tetanus are rare in the United States and other parts of the developed world. The disease remains a threat to people who aren't up to date on their vaccinations. It's more common in developing countries.","The average time from infection to appearance of signs and symptoms (incubation period) is 10 days. The incubation period can range from 3 to 21 days. | The most common type of tetanus is called generalized tetanus. Signs and symptoms begin gradually and then progressively worsen over two weeks.

Usually, the neck and back arch, the legs become rigid, the arms are drawn up to the body, and the fists are clenched. Muscle rigidity in the neck and abdomen may cause breathing difficulties. | These severe spasms may be triggered by minor events that stimulate the senses — a loud sound, a physical touch, a draft or light. | As the disease progresses, other signs and symptoms may include: | High blood pressure | Low blood pressure | Rapid heart rate | Fever | Extreme sweating",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tetanus/symptoms-causes/syc-20351625
Tetralogy of Fallot,"Tetralogy of Fallot (teh-TRAL-uh-jee of fuh-LOW) is a rare heart condition that is present at birth. That means it's a congenital heart defect. A baby born with the condition has four different heart problems.
These heart problems affect the structure of the heart. The condition causes altered blood flow through the heart and to the rest of the body. Babies with tetralogy of Fallot often have blue or gray skin color due to low oxygen levels.
Tetralogy of Fallot is usually diagnosed during pregnancy or soon after a baby is born. If the heart changes and symptoms are mild, tetralogy of Fallot may not be noticed or diagnosed until adulthood.
People who are diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot need surgery to fix the heart. They will need regular health checkups for life.","Tetralogy of Fallot symptoms depend on how much blood flow is blocked from leaving the heart to go to the lungs.

Thoracic aortic aneurysm,"A thoracic aortic aneurysm is a weakened area in the body's main artery in the chest. The body's main artery is called the aorta. When the aortic wall is weak, the artery may widen. When the vessel is significantly widened, it's called an aneurysm.
A thoracic aortic aneurysm also is called a thoracic aneurysm.
Treatment of a thoracic aortic aneurysm may vary from regular health checkups to emergency surgery. The type of treatment depends on the cause, size and growth rate of the thoracic aortic aneurysm.
Complications of a thoracic aortic aneurysm include rupture of the aorta or a life-threatening tear between the layers of the aorta's wall. The tear is called an aortic dissection. Rupture or dissection can lead to sudden death.
Thoracic aortic aneurysms are less common than aneurysms that form in the lower part of the aorta, called abdominal aortic aneurysms.","Thoracic aortic aneurysms often grow slowly. There are usually no symptoms, making them difficult to detect. Many start small and stay small. Others grow bigger over time. How quickly a thoracic aortic aneurysm may grow is difficult to predict. | As a thoracic aortic aneurysm grows, symptoms may include: | Back pain. | Cough. | Weak, scratchy voice. | Shortness of breath. | Tenderness or pain in the chest. | Symptoms that a thoracic aortic aneurysm has ruptured or dissected include: | Sharp, sudden pain in the upper back that spreads downward. | Pain in the chest, jaw, neck or arms. | Difficulty breathing. | Low blood pressure. | Loss of consciousness. | Shortness of breath. | Trouble swallowing. | Some aneurysms may never rupture or lead to dissection.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thoracic-aortic-aneurysm/symptoms-causes/syc-20350188
Thoracic outlet syndrome,"Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a group of conditions in which there's pressure on blood vessels or nerves in the area between the neck and shoulder. This space is known as the thoracic outlet. Compression of the blood vessels and nerves can cause shoulder and neck pain. It also can cause numbness in the fingers.
Common causes of thoracic outlet syndrome include trauma from a car accident, repetitive injuries from a job or sport, and pregnancy. Differences in anatomy, such as having an extra or irregular rib, also can cause TOS. Sometimes the cause of thoracic outlet syndrome is not known.
Treatment often involves physical therapy and pain relief. Most people improve with these treatments. For some, surgery may be recommended.","There are three types of thoracic outlet syndrome: | Neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome.This is the most common type of thoracic outlet syndrome. In this type, a group of nerves called the brachial plexus is compressed. The nerves of the brachial plexus come from the spinal cord. The nerves control muscle movements and feeling in the shoulder, arm and hand. | Venous thoracic outlet syndrome.This type of thoracic outlet syndrome occurs when one or more of the veins under the collarbone are compressed and damaged. This can result in blood clots. | Arterial thoracic outlet syndrome.This is the least common type of TOS. It occurs when one of the arteries under the collarbone is compressed. The compression may cause injury to the artery resulting in a bulge, known as an aneurysm, or blood clot formation. | Thoracic outlet syndrome symptoms can vary depending on the type. When nerves are compressed, symptoms of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome include: | Numbness or tingling in the arm or fingers. | Pain or aches in the neck, shoulder, arm or hand. | Arm fatigue with activity. | A weakening grip. | Symptoms of venous thoracic outlet syndrome can include: | A change in the color of the hand or one or more fingers. | Hand or arm pain and swelling. | Symptoms of arterial thoracic outlet syndrome can include: | A pulsating lump near the collarbone. | Cold fingers, hands or arms. | Hand and arm pain. | A change in color in one or more of the fingers or the entire hand. | Weak or no pulse in the affected arm.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thoracic-outlet-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20353988

Throat cancer,"Throat cancer refers cancer that develops in your throat (pharynx) or voice box (larynx).
Your throat is a muscular tube that begins behind your nose and ends in your neck. Throat cancer most often begins in the flat cells that line the inside of your throat.
Your voice box sits just below your throat and also is susceptible to throat cancer. The voice box is made of cartilage and contains the vocal cords that vibrate to make sound when you talk.","Signs and symptoms of throat cancer may include: | A cough | Changes in your voice, such as hoarseness or not speaking clearly | Difficulty swallowing | Ear pain | A lump or sore that doesn't heal | A sore throat | Weight loss",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/throat-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20366462
Buerger disease,"Buerger disease is a rare disease of the arteries and veins in the arms and legs. In Buerger disease — also called thromboangiitis obliterans — blood vessels become blocked. This reduces blood flow to the affected areas. Blood clots may form in the blood vessels.
Over time, the lack of blood flow damages or destroys skin tissue. The damage can lead to infection and death of body tissue, called gangrene. Buerger disease is usually first seen in the feet. It may eventually affect the blood vessels of the hand. Blood clots may form in the small veins of the arms and legs.
People who get Buerger disease almost always smoke cigarettes or use other forms of tobacco, such as chewing tobacco. Quitting all forms of tobacco is the only way to stop Buerger disease. For those who don't quit, surgery to remove fingers and toes might be needed.","Buerger disease symptoms include: | Tingling or numbness in the fingers or toes. | Changes in skin color in the hands and feet. The skin may look pale gray, red or blue. Depending on your skin color, these color changes may be harder or easier to see. | Fingers and toes that turn white then blue when exposed to cold, known as Raynaud's disease. Depending on your skin color, these color changes may be harder or easier to see. | Pain in the feet that occurs with walking. The pain may make it difficult to walk long distances. | Painful open sores on fingers and toes. Pain in the fingers and toes may become severe and occur at rest. | Inflammation of a vein just below the skin's surface, due to a blood clot in the vein.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/buergers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350658
Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count),"Thrombocytopenia is a condition in which you have a low blood platelet count. Platelets (thrombocytes) are colorless blood cells that help blood clot. Platelets stop bleeding by clumping and forming plugs in blood vessel injuries.
Thrombocytopenia might occur as a result of a bone marrow disorder such as leukemia or an immune system problem. Or it can be a side effect of taking certain medications. It affects both children and adults.
Thrombocytopenia can be mild and cause few signs or symptoms. In rare cases, the number of platelets can be so low that dangerous internal bleeding occurs. Treatment options are available.","Thrombocytopenia signs and symptoms may include: | Easy or excessive bruising (purpura) | Superficial bleeding into the skin that appears as a rash of pinpoint-sized reddish-purple spots (petechiae), usually on the lower legs | Prolonged bleeding from cuts | Bleeding from your gums or nose | Blood in urine or stools | Unusually heavy menstrual flows | Fatigue | Enlarged spleen",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thrombocytopenia/symptoms-causes/syc-20378293
Thrombocytosis,"Platelets are parts of the blood that help form blood clots. Thrombocytosis (throm-boe-sie-TOE-sis) is a disorder in which your body produces too many platelets.
It's called reactive thrombocytosis or secondary thrombocytosis when the cause is an underlying condition, such as an infection.
Less commonly, when the high platelet count has no apparent underlying condition as a cause, the disorder is called primary thrombocythemia or essential thrombocythemia. This is a blood and bone marrow disease.
A high platelet level may be detected in a routine blood test known as a complete blood count. It's important to determine whether it's reactive thrombocytosis or essential thrombocythemia to choose the best treatment options.","People with high platelet levels often don't have signs or symptoms. When symptoms occur, they're often related to blood clots. Examples include: | Headache. | Confusion or changes in speech. | Chest pain. | Shortness of breath and nausea. | Weakness. | Burning pain in the hands or feet. | Less commonly, very high platelet levels may cause bleeding. This can cause: | Nosebleeds. | Bruising. | Bleeding from your mouth or gums. | Bloody stool.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thrombocytosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20378315

Oral thrush,"Oral thrush, also called oral candidiasis (kan-dih-DIE-uh-sis), is a condition in which the fungus Candida albicans builds up in the mouth. It's natural for candida, a yeast, to live in the mouth. But sometimes it can grow too much and cause symptoms.
Oral thrush causes creamy white patches or spots, usually on the tongue or inner cheeks. Sometimes oral thrush may spread to the roof of the mouth, gums or tonsils, or the back of your throat.
Although oral thrush can affect anyone, it's more likely to occur in babies and older adults because they have lower immunity. It's also more likely to occur in other people with weakened immune systems or certain health conditions or people who take certain medicines. Oral thrush is a minor problem if you're healthy. But if you have a weakened immune system, symptoms may be more serious and harder to control.",,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/oral-thrush/symptoms-causes/syc-20353533
Thumb arthritis,"Thumb arthritis is common with aging and occurs when cartilage wears away from the ends of the bones that form the joint at the base of your thumb — also known as the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint.
Thumb arthritis can cause severe pain, swelling, and decreased strength and range of motion, making it difficult to do simple tasks, such as turning doorknobs and opening jars. Treatment generally involves a combination of medication and splints. Severe thumb arthritis might require surgery.","Pain is the first and most common symptom of thumb arthritis. Pain can occur at the base of your thumb when you grip, grasp or pinch an object, or use your thumb to apply force. | Other signs and symptoms might include: | Swelling, stiffness and tenderness at the base of your thumb | Decreased strength when pinching or grasping objects | Decreased range of motion | Enlarged or bony appearance of the joint at the base of your thumb",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thumb-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20378339
Thunderclap headaches,"Thunderclap headaches live up to their name, striking suddenly like a clap of thunder. The pain of these severe headaches peaks within 60 seconds.
Thunderclap headaches are uncommon, but they can warn of potentially life-threatening conditions — usually having to do with bleeding in and around the brain. Seek emergency medical attention for a thunderclap headache.","Thunderclap headaches are dramatic. Symptoms include pain that: | Strikes suddenly and severely | Peaks within 60 seconds | Can be accompanied by nausea or vomiting | Thunderclap headaches might be accompanied by other signs and symptoms, such as: | Altered mental state | Fever | Seizures | These signs and symptoms might reflect the underlying cause.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thunderclap-headaches/symptoms-causes/syc-20378361
Thyroid cancer,"Thyroid cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the thyroid. The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of the neck, just below the Adam's apple. The thyroid produces hormones that regulate heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature and weight.
Thyroid cancer might not cause any symptoms at first. But as it grows, it can cause signs and symptoms, such as swelling in your neck, voice changes and difficulty swallowing.
Several types of thyroid cancer exist. Most types grow slowly, though some types can be very aggressive. Most thyroid cancers can be cured with treatment.
Thyroid cancer rates seem to be increasing. The increase may be caused by improved imaging technology that allows health care providers to find small thyroid cancers on CT and MRI scans done for other conditions (incidental thyroid cancers). Thyroid cancers found in this way are usually small cancers that respond well to treatments.","Most thyroid cancers don't cause any signs or symptoms early in the disease. As thyroid cancer grows, it may cause: | A lump (nodule) that can be felt through the skin on your neck | A feeling that close-fitting shirt collars are becoming too tight | Changes to your voice, including increasing hoarseness | Difficulty swallowing | Swollen lymph nodes in your neck | Pain in your neck and throat",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thyroid-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20354161

Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid),"Hyperthyroidism happens when the thyroid gland makes too much thyroid hormone. This condition also is called overactive thyroid. Hyperthyroidism speeds up the body's metabolism. That can cause many symptoms, such as weight loss, hand tremors, and rapid or irregular heartbeat.
Several treatments are available for hyperthyroidism. Anti-thyroid medicines and radioiodine can be used to slow the amount of hormones the thyroid gland makes. Sometimes, hyperthyroidism treatment includes surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid gland. In some cases, depending on what's causing it, hyperthyroidism may improve without medication or other treatment.","Hyperthyroidism sometimes looks like other health problems. That can make it hard to diagnose. It can cause many symptoms, including: | Losing weight without trying. | Fast heartbeat, a condition called tachycardia. | Irregular heartbeat, also called arrhythmia. | Pounding of the heart, sometimes called heart palpitations. | Increased hunger. | Nervousness, anxiety and irritability. | Tremor, usually a small trembling in the hands and fingers. | Sweating. | Changes in menstrual cycles. | Increased sensitivity to heat. | Changes in bowel patterns, especially more-frequent bowel movements. | Enlarged thyroid gland, sometimes called a goiter, which may appear as a swelling at the base of the neck. | Tiredness. | Muscle weakness. | Sleep problems. | Warm, moist skin. | Thinning skin. | Fine, brittle hair. | Older adults are more likely to have symptoms that are hard to notice.

Transient ischemic attack (TIA),"A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a short period of symptoms similar to those of a stroke. It's caused by a brief blockage of blood flow to the brain. ATIAusually lasts only a few minutes and doesn't cause long-term damage.
However, aTIAmay be a warning. About 1 in 3 people who has aTIAwill eventually have a stroke, with about half occurring within a year after theTIA.
Often called a ministroke, aTIAcan serve as both a warning of a future stroke and a chance to prevent it.","Transient ischemic attacks usually last a few minutes. Most symptoms disappear within an hour. Rarely, symptoms may last up to 24 hours. The symptoms of aTIAare similar to those found early in a stroke. Symptoms happen suddenly and may include: | Weakness, numbness or paralysis in the face, arm or leg, typically on one side of the body. | Slurred speech or trouble understanding others. | Blindness in one or both eyes or double vision. | Dizziness or loss of balance or coordination. | You may have more than oneTIA.

Trigeminal neuralgia,"Trigeminal neuralgia (try-JEM-ih-nul nu-RAL-juh) is a condition that causes intense pain similar to an electric shock on one side of the face. It affects the trigeminal nerve, which carries signals from the face to the brain. Even light touch from brushing your teeth or putting on makeup may trigger a jolt of pain. Trigeminal neuralgia can be long-lasting. It's known as a chronic pain condition.
People with trigeminal neuralgia may at first experience short, mild episodes of pain. But the condition can get worse, causing longer periods of pain that happen more often. It's more common in women and people older than 50.
But trigeminal neuralgia, also known as tic douloureux, doesn't mean living a life of pain. It usually can be managed with treatment.","Trigeminal neuralgia symptoms may include one or more of these patterns: | Episodes of intense shooting or jabbing pain that may feel like an electric shock. | Sudden episodes of pain or pain triggered by touching the face, chewing, speaking or brushing your teeth. | Episodes of pain lasting from a few seconds to several minutes. | Pain that occurs with facial spasms. | Episodes of pain lasting days, weeks, months or longer. Some people have periods when they experience no pain. | Pain in areas supplied by the trigeminal nerve. These areas include the cheek, jaw, teeth, gums or lips. Less often, the eye and forehead may be affected. | Pain on one side of the face at a time. | Pain focused in one spot.

Signs and symptoms of athlete's foot include an itchy, scaly rash. The condition is contagious and can be spread via contaminated floors, towels or clothing.
Athlete's foot is closely related to other fungal infections such as ringworm and jock itch. It can be treated with antifungal medications, but the infection often comes back.","Athlete's foot can affect one or both feet. Common signs and symptoms are: | Scaly, peeling or cracked skin between the toes | Itchiness, especially right after taking off shoes and socks | Inflamed skin that might appear reddish, purplish or grayish, depending on your skin color | Burning or stinging | Blisters | Dry, scaly skin on the bottom of the foot that extends up the side",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/athletes-foot/symptoms-causes/syc-20353841

Tinnitus,"Tinnitus is when you experience ringing or other noises in one or both of your ears. The noise you hear when you have tinnitus isn't caused by an external sound, and other people usually can't hear it. Tinnitus is a common problem. It affects about 15% to 20% of people, and is especially common in older adults.
Tinnitus is usually caused by an underlying condition, such as age-related hearing loss, an ear injury or a problem with the circulatory system. For many people, tinnitus improves with treatment of the underlying cause or with other treatments that reduce or mask the noise, making tinnitus less noticeable.","Tinnitus is most often described as a ringing in the ears, even though no external sound is present. However, tinnitus can also cause other types of phantom noises in your ears, including: | Buzzing | Roaring | Clicking | Hissing | Humming | Most people who have tinnitus have subjective tinnitus, or tinnitus that only you can hear. The noises of tinnitus may vary in pitch from a low roar to a high squeal, and you may hear it in one or both ears. In some cases, the sound can be so loud it interferes with your ability to concentrate or hear external sound. Tinnitus may be present all the time, or it may come and go. | In rare cases, tinnitus can occur as a rhythmic pulsing or whooshing sound, often in time with your heartbeat. This is called pulsatile tinnitus.

Nail fungus,"Nail fungus is a common infection of the nail. It begins as a white or yellow-brown spot under the tip of your fingernail or toenail. As the fungal infection goes deeper, the nail may discolor, thicken and crumble at the edge. Nail fungus can affect several nails.
If your condition is mild and not bothering you, you may not need treatment. If your nail fungus is painful and has caused thickened nails, self-care steps and medications may help. But even if treatment is successful, nail fungus often comes back.
Nail fungus is also called onychomycosis (on-ih-koh-my-KOH-sis). When fungus infects the areas between your toes and the skin of your feet, it's called athlete's foot (tinea pedis).","Symptoms of nail fungus include a nail or nails that are: | Thickened | Discolored | Brittle, crumbly or ragged | Misshapen | Separated from the nail bed | Smelly | Nail fungus can affect fingernails, but it's more common in toenails.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nail-fungus/symptoms-causes/syc-20353294
Tongue cancer,"Tongue cancer is a type of cancer that starts as a growth of cells on the tongue. The tongue begins in the throat and extends into the mouth. It's made up of muscles and nerves that help with movement and function, such as taste. The tongue aids in speaking, eating and swallowing.
Tongue cancer that starts in the mouth is different from tongue cancer that starts in the throat.
Several types of cancer can affect the tongue. Tongue cancer most often begins in the thin, flat cells that line the surface of the tongue, called squamous cells. Tongue cancer that starts in these cells is called squamous cell carcinoma.
Your health care team considers the type of cancer cells when making a treatment plan. The team also considers the location and size of the cancer. Tongue cancer treatment typically involves surgery and radiation therapy. Other options might be chemotherapy and targeted therapy.","Tongue cancer might not cause symptoms at first. Sometimes it's found by a doctor or dentist who examines the mouth for signs of cancer as part of a checkup. | When tongue cancer happens in the mouth, the first sign is often a sore on the tongue that doesn't heal. Other symptoms may include pain or bleeding in the mouth and a lump or thickening on the tongue. | When tongue cancer happens in the throat, the first sign can be swollen lymph nodes in the neck. Other symptoms may include coughing up blood, weight loss and ear pain. There also may be a lump in the back of the mouth, throat or neck. | Other tongue cancer symptoms may include: | A red or white patch on the tongue or lining of the mouth. | A sore throat that doesn't go away. | A feeling that something is caught in the throat. | Numbness of the mouth or tongue. | Difficulty or pain with chewing, swallowing, or moving the jaws or tongue. | Swelling of the jaw. | A change in voice.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tongue-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20378428

With tongue-tie, an unusually short, thick or tight band of tissue (lingual frenulum) tethers the bottom of the tongue's tip to the floor of the mouth. Depending on how much the tissue restricts tongue movement, it may interfere with breastfeeding. Someone who has tongue-tie might have difficulty sticking out the tongue. Tongue-tie can also affect eating or speaking.
Sometimes tongue-tie may not cause problems. Some cases may require a simple surgical procedure for correction.",Signs and symptoms of tongue-tie include: | Difficulty lifting the tongue to the upper teeth or moving the tongue from side to side. | Trouble sticking out the tongue past the lower front teeth. | A tongue that appears notched or heart shaped when stuck out.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tongue-tie/symptoms-causes/syc-20378452
Tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure,"A tonic-clonic seizure, previously known as a grand mal seizure, causes a loss of consciousness and violent muscle contractions. It's the type of seizure most people picture when they think about seizures.
During a seizure, there's a burst of electrical activity in the brain that causes changes in behavior and movements. Seizures can be focal, meaning the burst of electrical activity happens in one area of the brain. Or seizures can be generalized, in which they result in electrical activity in all areas of the brain. Tonic-clonic seizures may begin as focal seizures in a small area of the brain and spread to become generalized seizures that involve the whole brain.
Focal and generalized seizures have different symptoms. People who have generalized seizures usually lose consciousness. But people who have focal seizures may or may not lose consciousness. In tonic-clonic seizures, the muscles become stiff, causing the person to fall. Then the muscles alternately flex and relax.
Usually, a tonic-clonic seizure is caused by epilepsy. But sometimes this type of seizure can be triggered by other health problems, such as a high fever or damage to the brain.
Some people who have a tonic-clonic seizure don’t have another one and don't need treatment. But someone who has recurrent seizures may need treatment with daily anti-seizure medicines to control and prevent future tonic-clonic seizures. Surgery and dietary changes also may be options to manage your seizures.","Tonic-clonic seizures have two stages: | Tonic phase.Often, someone in the tonic phase will make a sound, such as a groan or yell. The muscles suddenly get stiff and cause the person to fall down. Loss of consciousness occurs. This phase tends to last about 10 to 20 seconds. | Clonic phase.The muscles go into rhythmic contractions. The arms and legs often jerk. They alternately flex and relax. Convulsions usually last 1 to 2 minutes or less. | The following symptoms occur in some but not all people with tonic-clonic seizures: | Loss of bowel and bladder function.This may happen during or following a seizure. | Not responding after convulsions.The person may not become conscious for several minutes after convulsions have ended. | Confusion.The person often is disoriented after a tonic-clonic seizure. This is referred to as postictal confusion. | Fatigue.Sleepiness is common after a tonic-clonic seizure. | Bad headache.Headaches may occur after a tonic-clonic seizure.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/grand-mal-seizure/symptoms-causes/syc-20363458

Cavities and tooth decay,"Cavities are areas in the hard surface of your teeth that are damaged. These areas of tooth decay become tiny openings or holes that can lead to a serious toothache, infection and tooth loss. There are several causes of cavities, including bacteria in your mouth, snacking a lot, sipping sugary drinks and not cleaning your teeth well.
Cavities and tooth decay are among the world's most common health problems. They're especially common in children, teenagers and older adults. But anyone who has teeth can get cavities, including babies.
If cavities aren't treated, they get larger and affect deeper layers of your teeth. Regular dental visits and good brushing and flossing habits are the best ways to protect your teeth from cavities.","The symptoms of cavities vary, depending on how many you have and where they're located. When a cavity is just beginning, you may not have any symptoms. As the decay gets larger, it may cause symptoms such as: | Toothache and other pain. | Tooth sensitivity. | Mild to sharp pain when eating or drinking something sweet, hot or cold. | Holes or pits in your teeth that you can see. | Brown, black or white staining on any surface of a tooth. | Pain when you bite down.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cavities/symptoms-causes/syc-20352892

Tics typically show up between ages 2 and 15, with the average being around 6 years of age. Males are about three to four times more likely than females to develop Tourette syndrome.
Although there's no cure for Tourette syndrome, treatments are available. Many people with Tourette syndrome don't need treatment when symptoms aren't troublesome. Tics often lessen or become controlled after the teen years.","Tics — sudden, brief, intermittent movements or sounds — are the hallmark sign of Tourette syndrome. They can range from mild to severe. Severe symptoms might significantly interfere with communication, daily functioning and quality of life. | Tics are classified as: | Simple tics.These sudden, brief and repetitive tics involve a limited number of muscle groups. | Complex tics.These distinct, coordinated patterns of movements involve several muscle groups. | Tics can also involve movement (motor tics) or sounds (vocal tics). Motor tics usually begin before vocal tics do. But the spectrum of tics that people experience is diverse. | In addition, tics can: | Vary in type, frequency and severity | Worsen if you're ill, stressed, anxious, tired or excited | Occur during sleep | Change over time | Worsen in the early teenage years and improve during the transition into adulthood | Before the onset of motor or vocal tics, you'll likely experience an uncomfortable bodily sensation (premonitory urge) such as an itch, a tingle or tension.

In some cases, toxic hepatitis develops within hours or days of exposure to a toxin. In other cases, it may take months of regular use before signs and symptoms appear.
The symptoms of toxic hepatitis often go away when exposure to the toxin stops. But toxic hepatitis can permanently damage your liver, leading to irreversible scarring of liver tissue (cirrhosis) and in some cases to liver failure, which can be life-threatening.","Mild forms of toxic hepatitis may not cause any symptoms and may be detected only by blood tests.

Most people infected with the parasite do not have symptoms. Some people get flu-like symptoms. Serious disease most often affects infants and people with weakened immune systems. Toxoplasmosis during pregnancy may cause miscarriage and birth defects.
Most infections don't need treatment. Drug treatment is used for people with more-serious cases, pregnant people, newborns and people with weakened immune systems. Several steps to prevent toxoplasmosis can lower the risk of infection.","Most people infected with toxoplasmosis do not have any symptoms. They often don't know they're infected. Some people have flu-like symptoms, including: | Fever. | Swollen lymph nodes that may last for weeks. | Headache. | Muscle aches. | Skin rash.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/toxoplasmosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20356249
Trachoma,"Trachoma (truh-KOH-muh) is a bacterial infection that affects your eyes. It's caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. Trachoma is contagious, spreading through contact with the eyes, eyelids, and nose or throat secretions of infected people. It can also be passed on by handling infected items, such as handkerchiefs.
At first, trachoma may cause mild itching and irritation of your eyes and eyelids. Then you may notice swollen eyelids and pus draining from the eyes. Untreated trachoma can lead to blindness.
Trachoma is the leading preventable cause of blindness worldwide. Most trachoma cases occur in poor areas of Africa, where 85% of people with active disease reside. In areas where trachoma is prevalent, infection rates among children under 5 can be 60% or more.
Early treatment may help prevent trachoma complications.","Signs and symptoms of trachoma usually affect both eyes and may include: | Mild itching and irritation of the eyes and eyelids | Eye discharge containing mucus or pus | Eyelid swelling | Light sensitivity (photophobia) | Eye pain | Eye redness | Vision loss | Young children are particularly susceptible to infection. But the disease progresses slowly, and the more painful symptoms may not emerge until adulthood. | The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified five stages in the development of trachoma: | Inflammation — follicular.The early infection has five or more follicles — small bumps that contain lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell — visible with magnification on the inner surface of your upper eyelid (conjunctiva). | Inflammation — intense.In this stage, your eye is now highly infectious and becomes irritated, with a thickening or swelling of the upper eyelid. | Eyelid scarring.Repeated infections lead to scarring of the inner eyelid. The scars often appear as white lines when examined with magnification. Your eyelid may become distorted and may turn in (entropion). | In-turned eyelashes (trichiasis).The scarred inner lining of your eyelid continues to deform, causing your lashes to turn in so that they rub on and scratch the transparent outer surface of your eye (cornea). | Corneal clouding (opacity).The cornea becomes affected by an inflammation that is most commonly seen under your upper lid. Continuous inflammation compounded by scratching from the in-turned lashes leads to clouding of the cornea. | All the signs of trachoma are more severe in your upper lid than in your lower lid. Without intervention, a disease process that begins in childhood can continue to advance into adulthood.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/trachoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20378505
Transposition of the great arteries,"Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) is a serious, rare heart problem in which the two main arteries leaving the heart are reversed. The condition is present at birth, which means it's a congenital heart defect.","Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) may be seen in a baby before birth during a routine pregnancy ultrasound. | But some people with the congenitally corrected type ofTGAmay not have symptoms for many years. | Symptoms of transposition of the great arteries after birth include: | Blue or gray skin. Depending on the baby's skin color, these color changes may be harder or easier to see. | Weak pulse. | Lack of appetite. | Poor weight gain. | Skin color changes may not be noticed right away if a baby withTGAalso has other heart problems. This is because the other heart problems may let some oxygen-rich blood move through the body. But as the baby becomes more active, less blood flows through the body.

Complicated grief,"Losing a loved one is one of the most distressing and, unfortunately, common experiences people face. Most people experiencing normal grief and bereavement have a period of sorrow, numbness, and even guilt and anger. Gradually these feelings ease, and it's possible to accept loss and move forward.
For some people, feelings of loss are debilitating and don't improve even after time passes. This is known as complicated grief, sometimes called persistent complex bereavement disorder. In complicated grief, painful emotions are so long lasting and severe that you have trouble recovering from the loss and resuming your own life.
Different people follow different paths through the grieving experience. The order and timing of these phases may vary from person to person:
These differences are normal. But if you're unable to move through these stages more than a year after the death of a loved one, you may have complicated grief. If so, seek treatment. It can help you come to terms with your loss and reclaim a sense of acceptance and peace.","During the first few months after a loss, many signs and symptoms of normal grief are the same as those of complicated grief. However, while normal grief symptoms gradually start to fade over time, those of complicated grief linger or get worse.

It involves frequent, repeated and irresistible urges to pull out hair from your scalp, eyebrows or other areas of your body. You may try to resist the urges, but you can't stop. Trichotillomania is part of a group of conditions known as body-focused repetitive behaviors.
Pulling out hair from the scalp often leaves patchy bald spots. This can cause a lot of distress and can affect your work, school and social life. You may go to great lengths to hide the hair loss.
For some people, trichotillomania may be mild and can be managed. For others, the automatic or deliberate urge to pull out hair is too much to handle emotionally. Some treatment options may help reduce hair pulling or stop it entirely.","Symptoms of trichotillomania often include: | Repeatedly pulling out your hair, whether it's automatic or on purpose, usually from your scalp, eyebrows or eyelashes, but sometimes from other body areas. The sites may vary over time. | An increasing sense of tension before pulling out your hair, or when you try to resist pulling. | A sense of pleasure or relief after the hair is pulled out. | Hair loss that's easy to see, such as shortened hair or thinned or bald areas on the scalp or other areas of your body. This may include thin or missing eyelashes or eyebrows. | Pulling out specific types of hair, taking the same steps in the same way each time hair is pulled out or pulling out hair in certain patterns. | Biting, chewing or eating pulled-out hair. | Playing with pulled-out hair or rubbing it across your lips or face. | Repeatedly trying to stop pulling out your hair or trying to do it less often without success. | Experiencing a great deal of distress or problems at work, school or in social situations related to pulling out your hair. | Often trichotillomania also includes picking your skin, biting your nails or chewing your lips.

An episode can last from a few seconds to hours. You may try to hide your condition from others. | With trichotillomania, pulling out hair can be: | Automatic.You may pull out your hair without even realizing that you're doing it. This might happen, for example, when you're bored, reading or watching TV. | Focused.You may pull out your hair on purpose to relieve tension or distress. You may develop specific rituals for pulling out hair, such as finding just the right hair. You may play with, bite or eat pulled-out hairs. | You may do both automatic and focused hair pulling, depending on the situation and your mood. Certain positions or activities may trigger pulling out hair, such as resting your head on your hand or brushing your hair. | Trichotillomania can be related to emotions, including: | Negative feelings.Pulling out hair may be a way of dealing with negative or uncomfortable feelings, such as stress, anxiety, tension, boredom, loneliness, extreme tiredness or frustration. | Positive feelings.You may find that pulling out hair feels satisfying and provides some relief. As a result, you may continue to pull out your hair to keep these positive feelings. | Trichotillomania is a long-term disorder. If not treated, symptoms may come and go for weeks, months or years at a time. Also, symptoms can vary in severity over time. For example, hormone changes during the menstrual period can worsen symptoms in some females.

Tricuspid valve disease often happens with other heart valve diseases.
There are different types of tricuspid valve disease. Symptoms and treatment depend on the specific valve condition. Treatment may include regular health checkups, medicines, or a procedure or surgery to fix or replace the valve.","Symptoms of tricuspid valve disease depend on the specific valve condition and how severe it is. | Tricuspid stenosis symptoms are often mild. Symptoms may include: | A fast, pounding heartbeat. | Fluttering feeling in the neck. | Fatigue. | People with tricuspid regurgitation may not have symptoms.

Down syndrome,"Down syndrome is a genetic condition caused when an unusual cell division results in an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 21. This extra genetic material causes the developmental changes and physical features of Down syndrome.
The term ""syndrome"" refers to a set of symptoms that tend to happen together. With a syndrome, there is a pattern of differences or problems. The condition is named after an English physician, John Langdon Down, who first described it.
Down syndrome varies in severity among individuals. The condition causes lifelong intellectual disability and developmental delays. It's the most common genetic chromosomal cause of intellectual disabilities in children. It also commonly causes other medical conditions, including heart and digestive system problems.
Better understanding of Down syndrome and early interventions can greatly improve the quality of life for children and adults with this condition and help them live fulfilling lives.","Each person with Down syndrome is an individual. Problems with intellect and development are usually mild to moderate. Some people are healthy while others have serious health issues such as heart problems that are present at birth. | Children and adults with Down syndrome have distinct face and body features.

Having only one large blood vessel means that oxygen-poor and oxygen-rich blood mix. This mixing reduces the amount of oxygen delivered to the body. It usually increases the amount of blood flow into the lungs too. The heart has to work harder to adjust for the changes in blood flow.
A baby, also called a fetus, with truncus arteriosus also usually has a hole between the two lower heart chambers, called the ventricles. The hole is called a ventricular septal defect.
Another name for truncus arteriosus is common arterial trunk.",Symptoms of truncus arteriosus most often occur in the first few days of life. They include: | Blue or gray skin due to low oxygen levels. | Extreme sleepiness. | Poor feeding. | Poor growth. | Pounding heartbeat. | Fast breathing. | Shortness of breath.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/truncus-arteriosus/symptoms-causes/syc-20364247

Tuberous sclerosis,"Tuberous sclerosis (TOO-bur-us skluh-ROH-sis), also called tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), is an uncommon genetic disorder that causes tumors to develop in many parts of the body. These tumors are not cancer. Noncancerous tumors, also called benign tumors, are overgrowths of cells and tissue that are not expected. Symptoms vary widely, depending on where the growths develop and how big they get.
Tuberous sclerosis is often first found during infancy or childhood. Sometimes tuberous sclerosis can have such mild symptoms that the condition isn't diagnosed until adulthood, or it's not diagnosed at all. Sometimes tuberous sclerosis causes serious disabilities.
There is no cure for tuberous sclerosis, and the course of the disorder and how bad it gets can't be predicted. But treatments are available to manage symptoms.","Tuberous sclerosis symptoms are caused by noncancerous growths in parts of the body, most commonly in the skin, brain, eyes, kidneys, heart and lungs. But any part of the body can be affected. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, depending on the size or location of the growths. | Although symptoms are different for each person with tuberous sclerosis, they can include: | Skin changes.Skin changes are most common.

Small soft bumps under or around the nails may occur. Growths on the face that start in childhood and look like acne are common. | Seizures.Growths in the brain may be linked with seizures. A seizure is often the first symptom of tuberous sclerosis. In small children, a common type of seizure called infantile spasm involves stiffening of the arms and legs and arching the back and head. | Problems in thinking, reasoning and learning.Tuberous sclerosis can result in developmental delays. Sometimes it limits the ability to think, reason and learn.

Salivary gland tumors,"Salivary gland tumors are growths of cells that start in the salivary glands. Salivary gland tumors are rare.
The salivary glands make saliva. Saliva aids in digestion, keeps the mouth moist and supports healthy teeth. There are three pairs of major salivary glands under and behind the jaw. These are the parotid, sublingual and submandibular glands. Many other tiny salivary glands are in the lips, inside the cheeks, and throughout the mouth and throat.
Salivary gland tumors can happen in any salivary gland. Most salivary gland tumors occur in the parotid gland. Of these, most aren't cancer. For every five parotid gland tumors, on average, only one is found to be cancerous.
Treatment for salivary gland tumors is usually with surgery to remove the tumor. People with salivary gland cancers may need additional treatments.",Signs and symptoms of a salivary gland tumor may include: | A lump or swelling on or near the jaw or in the neck or mouth. | Muscle weakness on one side of the face. | Numbness in part of the face. | Ongoing pain near a salivary gland. | Trouble opening the mouth widely. | Trouble swallowing.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/salivary-gland-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20354151

Type 1 diabetes,"Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition. In this condition, the pancreas makes little or no insulin. Insulin is a hormone the body uses to allow sugar (glucose) to enter cells to produce energy.
Different factors, such as genetics and some viruses, may cause type 1 diabetes. Although type 1 diabetes usually appears during childhood or adolescence, it can develop in adults.
Even after a lot of research, type 1 diabetes has no cure. Treatment is directed toward managing the amount of sugar in the blood using insulin, diet and lifestyle to prevent complications.",Type 1 diabetes symptoms can appear suddenly and may include: | Feeling more thirsty than usual | Urinating a lot | Bed-wetting in children who have never wet the bed during the night | Feeling very hungry | Losing weight without trying | Feeling irritable or having other mood changes | Feeling tired and weak | Having blurry vision,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-1-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20353011
Type 1 diabetes in children,"Type 1 diabetes in children is a condition in which your child's body no longer produces an important hormone (insulin). Your child needs insulin to survive, so the missing insulin needs to be replaced with injections or with an insulin pump. Type 1 diabetes in children used to be known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes.
The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children can be overwhelming, especially in the beginning. Suddenly you and your child — depending on your child's age — must learn how to give injections, count carbohydrates and monitor blood sugar.
There's no cure for type 1 diabetes in children, but it can be managed.

Type 2 diabetes,"Type 2 diabetes happens when the body cannot use insulin correctly and sugar builds up in the blood. It was once called adult-onset diabetes.
Over time, high blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes can damage the eyes, kidneys, nerves and heart. This can happen because the pancreas doesn't make enough of a hormone called insulin that helps sugar enter the cells. It happens also because the cells respond poorly to insulin by taking in less sugar.
Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can begin during childhood and adulthood. Type 2 is more common in older adults. But the increase in the number of children with obesity has led to more young people with type 2 diabetes.
There's no cure for type 2 diabetes. Losing weight, eating well and exercising can help manage the condition. If diet and exercise aren't enough to manage blood sugar, diabetes medicines or insulin therapy may help.","Symptoms of type 2 diabetes often come on slowly. In fact, people can live with type 2 diabetes for years and not know it.

Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid),"Hypothyroidism happens when the thyroid gland doesn't make enough thyroid hormone. This condition also is called underactive thyroid. Hypothyroidism may not cause noticeable symptoms in its early stages. Over time, hypothyroidism that isn't treated can lead to other health problems, such as high cholesterol and heart problems.
Blood tests are used to diagnose hypothyroidism. Treatment with thyroid hormone medicine usually is simple, safe and effective once you and your health care provider find the right dosage for you.","The symptoms of hypothyroidism depend on the severity of the condition. Problems tend to develop slowly, often over several years. | At first, you may barely notice the symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue and weight gain. Or you may think they are just part of getting older. But as your metabolism continues to slow, you may develop more-obvious problems. | Hypothyroidism symptoms may include: | Tiredness. | More sensitivity to cold. | Constipation. | Dry skin. | Weight gain. | Puffy face. | Hoarse voice. | Coarse hair and skin. | Muscle weakness. | Muscle aches, tenderness and stiffness. | Menstrual cycles that are heavier than usual or irregular. | Thinning hair. | Slowed heart rate, also called bradycardia. | Depression. | Memory problems.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypothyroidism/symptoms-causes/syc-20350284
Bags under eyes,"Bags under eyes are mild swelling or puffiness under the eyes. They're common as you age and the tissues around your eyes weaken, including some of the muscles supporting your eyelids. Fat that helps support the eyes can then move into the lower eyelids, causing them to appear puffy. Fluid may also accumulate below your eyes.
Bags under eyes are usually a cosmetic concern and rarely a sign of a serious condition. At-home remedies, such as cool compresses, can help improve their appearance. For persistent or bothersome under-eye puffiness, eyelid surgery may be an option.",Symptoms of bags under eyes can include: | Mild swelling | Saggy or loose skin | Dark circles,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bags-under-eyes/symptoms-causes/syc-20369927
Undescended testicle,"A testicle that doesn't move down into its proper place in the scrotum before birth is called an undescended testicle. It's also known as cryptorchidism (krip-TOR-kih-diz-um). Most often, it's just one testicle that doesn't descend into the scrotum, which is the bag of skin that hangs below the penis. But sometimes both testicles are affected.
An undescended testicle is more common in premature babies than it is in full-term infants. An undescended testicle often moves down on its own within a few months after the baby is born. If your baby has an undescended testicle that doesn't correct itself, surgery can be done to move the testicle into the scrotum.","Not seeing or feeling a testicle in the scrotum is the main symptom of an undescended testicle. | Testicles form in an unborn baby's lower belly. During the last few months of pregnancy, the testicles typically move down from the stomach area. They move through a tubelike passage in the groin, called the inguinal canal, and descend into the scrotum. With an undescended testicle, that process stops or is delayed.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/undescended-testicle/symptoms-causes/syc-20351995
Indigestion,"Indigestion — also called dyspepsia or an upset stomach — is discomfort in your upper abdomen. Indigestion describes certain symptoms, such as belly pain and a feeling of fullness soon after you start eating, rather than a specific disease. Indigestion can also be a symptom of other digestive disorders.
Although indigestion is common, each person may experience indigestion in a slightly different way. Symptoms of indigestion may be felt occasionally or as often as daily.
Indigestion may often be relieved with lifestyle changes and medicines.","If you have indigestion, you may have: | Early fullness during a meal.You haven't eaten much of your meal, but you already feel full and may not be able to finish eating. | Uncomfortable fullness after a meal.The feeling of fullness lasts longer than it should. | Discomfort in the upper abdomen.You feel a mild to severe pain in the area between the bottom of your breastbone and your bellybutton. | Burning in the upper abdomen.You feel an uncomfortable heat or burning sensation between the bottom of your breastbone and your bellybutton. | Bloating in the upper abdomen.You feel an uncomfortable sensation of tightness in your upper abdomen. | Nausea.You feel as if you want to vomit. | Less frequent symptoms include vomiting and belching. | Sometimes people with indigestion also experience heartburn. Heartburn is a pain or burning feeling in the center of your chest that may radiate into your neck or back during or after eating.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/indigestion/symptoms-causes/syc-20352211
Ureteral cancer,"Ureteral cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the ureters. The ureters are tubes that connect the kidneys to the bladder. The ureters are part of the urinary tract. They carry urine produced by the kidneys to the bladder.
Ureteral cancer is not common. When it happens, it occurs most often in older adults and in people who have had bladder cancer.
Ureteral cancer is closely related to bladder cancer. The cells that line the ureters are the same type of cells that line the inside of the bladder. People diagnosed with ureteral cancer have an increased risk of bladder cancer. So people with ureteral cancer are usually tested for signs of bladder cancer.
Treatment for ureteral cancer typically involves surgery. In certain situations, chemotherapy, immunotherapy or targeted therapy may be recommended.","Signs and symptoms of ureteral cancer include: | Blood in the urine, which may make the urine look red, pink or cola colored. | Back pain. | Pain when urinating. | Losing weight without trying. | Feeling very tired.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ureteral-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20360721
Ureteral obstruction,"A ureteral obstruction is a blockage in one or both of the tubes (ureters) that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder. Ureteral obstruction can be cured. However, if it's not treated, symptoms can quickly move from mild — pain, fever and infection — to severe — loss of kidney function, sepsis and death.
Ureteral obstruction is fairly common. Because it's treatable, severe complications are rare.","Ureteral obstruction might have no signs or symptoms. Signs and symptoms depend on where the obstruction occurs, whether it's partial or complete, how quickly it develops, and whether it affects one or both kidneys. | Signs and symptoms might include: | Pain. | Changes in how much urine you produce (urine output). | Difficulty urinating. | Blood in the urine. | Urinary tract infections. | High blood pressure (hypertension).",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ureteral-obstruction/symptoms-causes/syc-20354676
Urethral stricture,"A urethral (u-REE-thrul) stricture involves scarring that narrows the tube that carries urine out of the body, called the urethra. As a result of a stricture, less urine comes out of the bladder. This can cause problems in the urinary tract, such as infection.",Symptoms of urethral stricture can include: | Weak urine stream. | Bladder not emptying all the way. | Spraying urine. | Finding it hard or painful to pass urine. | Passing urine more often or feeling the need to pass urine more often. | Urinary tract infection.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urethral-stricture/symptoms-causes/syc-20362330
Urinary incontinence,"Urinary incontinence — the loss of bladder control — is a common and often embarrassing problem. The severity ranges from occasionally leaking urine when you cough or sneeze to having an urge to urinate that's so sudden and strong you don't get to a toilet in time.
Though it occurs more often as people get older, urinary incontinence isn't an inevitable consequence of aging. If urinary incontinence affects your daily activities, don't hesitate to see your doctor. For most people, simple lifestyle and dietary changes or medical care can treat symptoms of urinary incontinence.","Many people experience occasional, minor leaks of urine. Others may lose small to moderate amounts of urine more frequently. | Types of urinary incontinence include: | Stress incontinence.Urine leaks when you exert pressure on your bladder by coughing, sneezing, laughing, exercising or lifting something heavy. | Urge incontinence.You have a sudden, intense urge to urinate followed by an involuntary loss of urine. You may need to urinate often, including throughout the night. Urge incontinence may be caused by a minor condition, such as infection, or a more severe condition such as a neurological disorder or diabetes. | Overflow incontinence.You experience frequent or constant dribbling of urine due to a bladder that doesn't empty completely. | Functional incontinence.A physical or mental impairment keeps you from making it to the toilet in time. For example, if you have severe arthritis, you may not be able to unbutton your pants quickly enough. | Mixed incontinence.You experience more than one type of urinary incontinence — most often this refers to a combination of stress incontinence and urge incontinence.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-incontinence/symptoms-causes/syc-20352808
Urinary tract infection (UTI),"A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection in any part of the urinary system. The urinary system includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. Most infections involve the lower urinary tract — the bladder and the urethra.
Women are at greater risk of developing aUTIthan are men. If an infection is limited to the bladder, it can be painful and annoying. But serious health problems can result if aUTIspreads to the kidneys.
Health care providers often treat urinary tract infections with antibiotics. You can also take steps to lower the chance of getting aUTIin the first place.","UTIs don't always cause symptoms. When they do, they may include: | A strong urge to urinate that doesn't go away | A burning feeling when urinating | Urinating often, and passing small amounts of urine | Urine that looks cloudy | Urine that appears red, bright pink or cola-colored — signs of blood in the urine | Strong-smelling urine | Pelvic pain, in women — especially in the center of the pelvis and around the area of the pubic bone | In older adults,UTIs may be overlooked or mistaken for other conditions.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-tract-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20353447
Urine color,"Regular urine color ranges from clear to pale yellow. But certain things can change the color.
Foods such as beets, blackberries and fava beans can turn urine pink or red, for example. And some medicines can give urine vivid tones, such as orange or greenish-blue.
An unusual urine color also can be a sign of a health problem. For instance, some urinary tract infections can turn urine milky white. Kidney stones, some cancers and other diseases sometimes make urine look red due to blood.","The regular color of urine varies. It depends on how much water you drink. Fluids dilute the yellow pigments in urine. So the more you drink, the clearer your urine looks. When you drink less, the yellow color becomes stronger. | But urine can turn colors far beyond what's typical, including: | Red. | Blue. | Green. | Orange. | Dark brown. | Cloudy white.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urine-color/symptoms-causes/syc-20367333
Blood in urine (hematuria),"It can be scary to see blood in urine, also called hematuria. In many cases, the cause is harmless. But blood in urine also can be a sign of a serious illness.
If you can see the blood, it's called gross hematuria. Blood that can't be seen with the naked eye is called microscopic hematuria. It's such a small amount that it can be seen only under a microscope when a lab tests the urine. Either way, it's important to figure out the reason for the bleeding.
Treatment depends on the cause.","Blood in the urine can look pink, red or cola-colored. Red blood cells cause the urine to change color. It takes only a small amount of blood to turn urine red. | The bleeding often isn't painful. But if blood clots get passed in the urine, that can hurt.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/blood-in-urine/symptoms-causes/syc-20353432
Hives and angioedema,"Hives — also known as urticaria (ur-tih-KAR-e-uh) — is a skin reaction that causes itchy welts that range in size from small spots to large blotches. Hives can be triggered by many situations and substances, including certain foods and medications.
Angioedema can arise with hives or alone. It causes swelling in the deeper layers of skin, often around the face and lips. Short-lived (acute) hives and angioedema are common. Most times, they are harmless, clear up within in a day and don't leave any lasting marks, even without treatment. Hives that last longer than six weeks are called chronic hives.
Hives and angioedema are usually treated with antihistamine medication. Angioedema can be life-threatening if swelling of the tongue or in the throat blocks the airway.",,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hives-and-angioedema/symptoms-causes/syc-20354908
Chronic hives,"Hives — also called urticaria (ur-tih-KAR-e-uh) — is a skin reaction that causes itchy welts. Chronic hives are welts that last for more than six weeks and return often over months or years. Often, the cause of chronic hives isn't clear.
The welts often start as itchy patches that turn into swollen welts that vary in size. These welts appear and fade at random as the reaction runs its course. Each individual welt typically lasts less than 24 hours.
Chronic hives can be very uncomfortable and interfere with sleep and daily activities. For many people, anti-itch medicines, called antihistamines, provide relief.","Symptoms of chronic hives include: | Batches of welts, called weals, that can arise anywhere on the body. | Welts that might be red, purple or skin-colored, depending on your skin color. | Welts that vary in size, change shape, and appear and fade repeatedly. | Itchiness, also called pruritus, which can be intense. | Painful swelling, called angioedema, around the eyes, cheeks or lips. | Flares triggered by heat, exercise or stress. | Symptoms that persist for more than six weeks and recur often and anytime, sometimes for months or years.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-hives/symptoms-causes/syc-20352719
Endometrial cancer,"Endometrial cancer is a type of cancer that begins as a growth of cells in the uterus. The uterus is the hollow, pear-shaped pelvic organ where fetal development happens.
Endometrial cancer begins in the layer of cells that form the lining of the uterus, called the endometrium. Endometrial cancer is sometimes called uterine cancer. Other types of cancer can form in the uterus, including uterine sarcoma, but they are much less common than endometrial cancer.
Endometrial cancer is often found at an early stage because it causes symptoms. Often the first symptom is irregular vaginal bleeding. If endometrial cancer is found early, surgically removing the uterus often cures it.",Symptoms of endometrial cancer may include: | Vaginal bleeding after menopause. | Bleeding between periods. | Pelvic pain.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/endometrial-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352461
Uterine fibroids,"Uterine fibroids are common growths of the uterus. They often appear during the years you're usually able to get pregnant and give birth. Uterine fibroids are not cancer, and they almost never turn into cancer. They aren't linked with a higher risk of other types of cancer in the uterus either. They're also called leiomyomas (lie-o-my-O-muhs) or myomas.
Fibroids vary in number and size. You can have a single fibroid or more than one. Some of these growths are too small to see with the eyes. Others can grow to the size of a grapefruit or larger. A fibroid that gets very big can distort the inside and the outside of the uterus. In extreme cases, some fibroids grow large enough to fill the pelvis or stomach area. They can make a person look pregnant.
Many people have uterine fibroids sometime during their lives. But you might not know you have them, because they often cause no symptoms. Your health care professional may just happen to find fibroids during a pelvic exam or pregnancy ultrasound.","Many people who have uterine fibroids don't have any symptoms. In those who do, symptoms can be influenced by the location, size and number of fibroids. | The most common symptoms of uterine fibroids include: | Heavy menstrual bleeding or painful periods. | Longer or more frequent periods. | Pelvic pressure or pain. | Frequent urination or trouble urinating. | Growing stomach area. | Constipation. | Pain in the stomach area or lower back, or pain during sex. | Rarely, a fibroid can cause sudden, serious pain when it outgrows its blood supply and starts to die. | Often, fibroids are grouped by their location. Intramural fibroids grow within the muscular wall of the uterus. Submucosal fibroids bulge into the uterine cavity.

Uterine prolapse,"Uterine prolapse occurs when pelvic floor muscles and ligaments stretch and weaken until they no longer provide enough support for the uterus. As a result, the uterus slips down into or protrudes out of the vagina.
Uterine prolapse most often affects people after menopause who've had one or more vaginal deliveries.
Mild uterine prolapse usually doesn't require treatment. But uterine prolapse that causes discomfort or disrupts daily life might benefit from treatment.","Mild uterine prolapse is common after childbirth. It generally doesn't cause symptoms. Symptoms of moderate to severe uterine prolapse include: | Seeing or feeling tissue bulge out of the vagina | Feeling heaviness or pulling in the pelvis | Feeling like the bladder doesn't empty all the way when you use the bathroom | Problems with leaking urine, also called incontinence | Trouble having a bowel movement and needing to press the vagina with your fingers to help have a bowel movement | Feeling as if you're sitting on a small ball | Feeling as if you have vaginal tissue rubbing on clothing | Pressure or discomfort in the pelvis or low back | Sexual concerns, such as feeling as though the vaginal tissue is loose",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/uterine-prolapse/symptoms-causes/syc-20353458

Vaginal agenesis,"Vaginal agenesis (a-JEN-uh-sis) is a rare disorder in which the vagina doesn't develop, and the womb (uterus) may only develop partially or not at all. This condition is present before birth and may also be associated with kidney or skeletal problems.
The condition is also known as mullerian agenesis, mullerian aplasia or Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome.
Vaginal agenesis is often identified at puberty when a female does not begin menstruating. Use of a vaginal dilator, a tubelike device that can stretch the vagina when used over a period of time, is often successful in creating a vagina. In some cases, surgery may be needed. Treatment makes it possible to have vaginal intercourse.","Vaginal agenesis often goes unnoticed until females reach their teens, but don't menstruate (amenorrhea). Other signs of puberty usually follow typical female development. | Vaginal agenesis may have these features: | The genitals look like a typical female. | The vagina may be shortened without a cervix at the end, or absent and marked only by a slight indentation where a vaginal opening would typically be located. | There may be no uterus or one that's only partially developed. If there's tissue lining the uterus (endometrium), monthly cramping or chronic abdominal pain may occur. | The ovaries typically are fully developed and functional, but they may be in an unusual location in the abdomen. Sometimes the pair of tubes that eggs travel through to get from the ovaries to the uterus (fallopian tubes) are absent or do not develop typically. | Vaginal agenesis may also be associated with other issues, such as: | Problems with development of the kidneys and urinary tract | Developmental changes in the bones of the spine, ribs and wrists | Hearing problems | Other congenital conditions that also involve the heart, gastrointestinal tract and limb growth",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vaginal-agenesis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355737

Vaginal cancer,"Vaginal cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the vagina. The cells multiply quickly and can invade and destroy healthy body tissue.
The vagina is part of the female reproductive system. It's a muscular tube that connects the uterus with the outer genitals. The vagina is sometimes called the birth canal.
Cancer that begins in the vagina is rare. Most cancer that happens in the vagina starts somewhere else and spreads to the vagina.
Vaginal cancer that's diagnosed when it's confined to the vagina has the best chance for a cure. When the cancer spreads beyond the vagina, it's much harder to treat.","Vaginal cancer may not cause any symptoms at first. As it grows, vaginal cancer may cause signs and symptoms, such as: | Vaginal bleeding that isn't typical, such as after menopause or after sex. | Vaginal discharge. | A lump or mass in the vagina. | Painful urination. | Frequent urination. | Constipation. | Pelvic pain.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vaginal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352447
Yeast infection (vaginal),"A vaginal yeast infection is a fungal infection. It causes irritation, discharge and itching of the vagina and the vulva. Vaginal yeast infection also is called vaginal candidiasis.
Vaginal yeast infection affects most people assigned female at birth at some point in life. Many have at least two infections.
People who don't have sex can get a vaginal yeast infection. So it isn't though of as a sexually transmitted infection. But you can get vaginal yeast infections through sex.
There's a higher risk of vaginal yeast infection when you start having sex. And some vaginal yeast infections may be linked to sexual contact between the mouth and genital area, called oral-genital sex.
Medicines can treat vaginal yeast infections. Yeast infections that happen four times or more a year may need a longer treatment course and a plan to prevent them.","Yeast infection symptoms range from mild to moderate. They may include: | Itching and irritation in the vagina and tissues at the vaginal opening, called the vulva. | A burning feeling, mainly during intercourse or while urinating. | Redness and swelling of the vulva. Redness may be harder to see on Black or brown skin than on white skin. | Vaginal pain and soreness. | Thick, white vaginal shedding of fluid and cells, called discharge, with little or no odor.

Vaginal fistula,"A vaginal fistula is an unusual opening that forms between the vagina and another organ, such as the bladder, colon or rectum. Your healthcare professional might describe a vaginal fistula as a hole in the vagina that lets urine, gas or stool pass through the vagina.
Vaginal fistulas can form after childbirth or after an injury, a surgery, an infection or radiation treatment. You may need surgery to fix a fistula.
There are various types of vaginal fistulas. They are named based on the location of the fistula and organs they affect:","Vaginal fistula symptoms can include: | Leaking of urine or stool, or passing of gas, through the vagina. | Urinary tract infections that happen often. | Urine that has an unusual odor or contains blood. | Vaginal fluid called discharge that looks or smells unusual. | Pain during sex. | Pain, swelling or irritation in the area between the vagina and the anus, called the perineum. | Repeated infections of the vagina. | The exact symptoms a person has depend in part on the location of the fistula.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vaginal-fistulas/symptoms-causes/syc-20355762
Posterior vaginal prolapse (rectocele),"A posterior vaginal prolapse is a bulge of tissue into the vagina. It happens when the tissue between the rectum and the vagina weakens or tears. This causes the rectum to push into the vaginal wall. Posterior vaginal prolapse is also called a rectocele (REK-toe-seel).
Childbirth-related tears, chronic straining to pass stool (constipation) and other activities that put pressure on pelvic tissues can lead to posterior vaginal prolapse. A small prolapse might not cause symptoms.
With a large prolapse, you might notice a bulge of tissue that pushes through the opening of the vagina. To pass stool, you might need to support the vaginal wall with your fingers. This is called splinting. The bulge can be uncomfortable, but it's rarely painful.
If needed, self-care measures and other nonsurgical options are often effective. For severe posterior vaginal prolapse, you might need surgery to fix it.","A small posterior vaginal prolapse (rectocele) might cause no symptoms. | Otherwise, you may notice: | A soft bulge of tissue in the vagina that might come through the opening of the vagina | Trouble having a bowel movement | Feeling pressure or fullness in the rectum | A feeling that the rectum has not completely emptied after a bowel movement | Sexual concerns, such as feeling embarrassed or sensing looseness in the tone of the vaginal tissue | Many women with posterior vaginal prolapse also have prolapse of other pelvic organs, such as the bladder or uterus.

Heart valve disease,"In heart valve disease, one or more of the valves in the heart doesn't work properly. There are four heart valves. They keep blood flowing through the heart in the correct direction. Sometimes a valve doesn't open or close all the way. This can change how blood flows through the heart to the rest of the body.
Heart valve disease treatment depends on the heart valve affected and the type and severity of the disease. Sometimes surgery is needed to repair or replace the heart valve.","Some people with heart valve disease might not have symptoms for many years. When symptoms occur, they might include: | Shortness of breath at rest or when active or lying down. | Fatigue. | Chest pain. | Dizziness. | Swelling of the ankles and feet. | Fainting. | Irregular heartbeat.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-valve-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353727

Chickenpox,"Chickenpox is an illness caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It brings on an itchy rash with small, fluid-filled blisters. Chickenpox spreads very easily to people who haven't had the disease or haven't gotten the chickenpox vaccine. Chickenpox used to be a widespread problem, but today the vaccine protects children from it.
The chickenpox vaccine is a safe way to prevent this illness and the other health problems that can happen during it.","The rash caused by chickenpox appears 10 to 21 days after you're exposed to the varicella-zoster virus. The rash often lasts about 5 to 10 days. Other symptoms that may appear 1 to 2 days before the rash include: | Fever. | Loss of appetite. | Headache. | Tiredness and a general feeling of being unwell. | Once the chickenpox rash appears, it goes through three phases: | Raised bumps called papules, which break out over a few days. | Small fluid-filled blisters called vesicles, which form in about one day and then break and leak. | Crusts and scabs, which cover the broken blisters and take a few more days to heal. | New bumps keep showing up for several days. So you may have bumps, blisters and scabs at the same time. You can spread the virus to other people for up to 48 hours before the rash appears. And the virus stays contagious until all broken blisters have crusted over. | The disease is by and large mild in healthy children. But sometimes, the rash can cover the whole body. Blisters may form in the throat and eyes. They also may form in tissue that lines the inside of the urethra, anus and vagina.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chickenpox/symptoms-causes/syc-20351282
Esophageal varices,"Esophageal varices are enlarged veins in the esophagus, the tube that connects the throat and stomach. Esophageal varices most often happen in people with serious liver diseases.
Esophageal varices form when regular blood flow to the liver is blocked by a clot or scar tissue in the liver. To go around the blockages, blood flows into smaller blood vessels that aren't designed to carry large volumes of blood. The vessels can leak blood or even burst, causing life-threatening bleeding.
A few medicines and medical procedures are available to help prevent or stop bleeding from esophageal varices.","Esophageal varices usually don't cause symptoms unless they bleed. Symptoms of bleeding esophageal varices include: | Vomiting large amounts of blood. | Black, tarry or bloody stools. | Lightheadedness due to blood loss. | Loss of consciousness in severe cases. | A healthcare professional might suspect esophageal varices if someone has signs of liver disease or has been diagnosed with liver cirrhosis, including: | Yellow coloration of your skin and eyes, known as jaundice. | Easy bleeding or bruising. | Fluid buildup in your belly, called ascites (uh-SAHY-teez).",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/esophageal-varices/symptoms-causes/syc-20351538
Varicocele,"A varicocele (VAR-ih-koe-seel) is an enlargement of the veins within the loose bag of skin that holds the testicles (scrotum). These veins transport oxygen-depleted blood from the testicles. A varicocele occurs when blood pools in the veins rather than circulating efficiently out of the scrotum.
Varicoceles usually form during puberty and develop over time. They may cause some discomfort or pain, but they often result in no symptoms or complications.
A varicocele may cause poor development of a testicle, low sperm production or other problems that may lead to infertility. Surgery to treat varicocele may be recommended to address these complications.","A varicocele usually occurs on the left side of the scrotum and often produces no signs or symptoms. Possible signs and symptoms may include: | Pain.A dull, aching pain or discomfort is more likely when standing or late in the day. Lying down often relieves pain. | A mass in the scrotum.If a varicocele is large enough, a mass like a ""bag of worms"" may be visible above the testicle. A smaller varicocele may be too small to see but noticeable by touch. | Differently sized testicles.The affected testicle may be noticeably smaller than the other testicle. | Infertility.A varicocele may lead to difficulty fathering a child, but not all varicoceles cause infertility.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/varicocele/symptoms-causes/syc-20378771
Varicose veins,"Varicose veins are bulging, enlarged veins. Any vein that is close to the skin's surface, called superficial, can become varicosed. Varicose veins most often affect the veins in the legs. That's because standing and walking increase the pressure in the veins of the lower body.
For many people, varicose veins are simply a cosmetic concern. So are spider veins, a common, mild form of varicose veins. But varicose veins can cause aching pain and discomfort. Sometimes they lead to more-serious health problems.
Treatment involves exercising, raising legs when sitting or lying down, or wearing compression stockings. A procedure may be done to close or remove veins.","Varicose veins might not cause pain. Symptoms of varicose veins include: | Veins that are dark purple, blue or the same color as the skin. Depending on skin color, these changes may be harder or easier to see. | Veins that look twisted and bulging. They often look like cords on the legs. | When there are painful symptoms of varicose veins, they might include: | An achy or heavy feeling in the legs. | Burning, throbbing, muscle cramping and swelling in the lower legs. | Worse pain after sitting or standing for a long time. | Itching around one or more of the veins. | Changes in skin color around a varicose vein. | Spider veins are like varicose veins, but they're smaller.

Smallpox,"Smallpox is a serious and often deadly viral infection. It's contagious — meaning it spreads from person to person — and can cause permanent scarring. Sometimes, it causes disfigurement.
Smallpox has affected humans for thousands of years but was wiped out worldwide by 1980 thanks to smallpox vaccines. It's no longer found naturally in the world. The last case of naturally occurring smallpox was reported in 1977.
Samples of smallpox virus have been kept for research purposes. And scientific advances have made it possible to create smallpox in a lab. This has led to concerns that smallpox could someday be used as a bioweapon.
Vaccines can prevent smallpox, but because most people are unlikely to come in contact with smallpox naturally, routine vaccination isn't recommended. New antiviral medications can be used to treat people who develop smallpox.","The first symptoms of smallpox usually appear 12 to 14 days after you're exposed to the smallpox virus. However, the virus can be in your body from 7 to 19 days before you look or feel sick. This time is called the incubation period. | After the incubation period, sudden flu-like symptoms occur. These include: | Fever | Muscle aches | Headache | Severe fatigue | Severe back pain | Vomiting, sometimes | A few days later, flat, red spots appear on the body. They may start in the mouth and on the tongue and then spread to the skin. The face, arms and legs are often affected first, followed by the torso, hands and feet. | Within a day or two, many of the spots turn into small blisters filled with clear fluid. Later, the blisters fill with pus. These sores are called pustules. Scabs form 8 to 9 days later and eventually fall off, leaving deep, pitted scars. | Smallpox can be spread from person to person when the rash appears and until the scabs fall off.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/smallpox/symptoms-causes/syc-20353027

Vasculitis,"Vasculitis involves swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of blood vessels. The inflammation can cause the walls of the blood vessels to thicken. This thickening can narrow the vessels. If the narrowing restricts blood flow, it can damage organs and tissues.
There are many types of vasculitis. Most of them are rare. Vasculitis might affect just one organ or several. The condition can be short-term or long lasting.
Vasculitis can affect anyone. But some types are more common among people in certain age groups. Some types may improve without treatment. Most types need treatment with medicines to control the inflammation and prevent flares.","Symptoms of most types of vasculitis can include: | Fever. | Headache. | Tiredness. | Weight loss. | Aches and pains. | Other symptoms depend on the parts of the body affected: | Digestive system.If vasculitis affects the stomach or intestines, there may be pain after eating. Ulcers and tears, called perforations, are possible. They may cause blood in the stool. | Ears.Dizziness, ringing in the ears and sudden hearing loss may happen. | Eyes.Vasculitis can make the eyes look red. They may itch or burn. Giant cell arteritis can cause double vision and brief or ongoing blindness in one or both eyes. This is sometimes the first sign of the disease. | Hands or feet.Some types of vasculitis can cause numbness or weakness in a hand or foot. The palms of the hands and soles of the feet might swell or harden. | Lungs.This can cause shortness of breath or coughing up blood. | Skin.Bleeding under the skin can show up as red spots. Vasculitis also can cause lumps or open sores on the skin.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vasculitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20363435

Vasovagal syncope,"Vasovagal syncope (vay-zoh-VAY-gul SING-kuh-pee) occurs when you faint because your body overreacts to certain triggers. These may include the sight of blood or extreme emotional distress. Vasovagal syncope also is called neurocardiogenic syncope.
The vasovagal syncope trigger causes your heart rate and blood pressure to drop suddenly. That leads to reduced blood flow to your brain, causing you to briefly lose consciousness.
Vasovagal syncope is usually harmless and requires no treatment. But it's possible that you may injure yourself during a vasovagal syncope episode. Your healthcare professional may recommend tests to rule out more-serious causes of fainting, such as heart conditions.","Before you faint due to vasovagal syncope, you may experience some of the following symptoms: | Change in skin color. | Lightheadedness. | Tunnel vision — your field of vision narrows so that you see only what's in front of you. | Upset stomach. | Feeling warm. | A cold, clammy sweat. | Blurred vision. | During a vasovagal syncope episode, people around you may notice: | Jerky movements. | A slow, weak pulse. | Dilated pupils. | Recovery after a vasovagal episode generally begins in less than a minute. However, if you stand up too soon after fainting — within about 15 to 30 minutes — you're at risk of fainting again.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vasovagal-syncope/symptoms-causes/syc-20350527
DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome),"DiGeorge syndrome, also known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, is a condition caused when a small part of chromosome 22 is missing. This deletion causes several body systems to develop poorly.
The term 22q11.2 deletion syndrome covers terms once thought to be different conditions. These terms include DiGeorge syndrome, velocardiofacial (vel-oh-cahr-dee-oh-fay-shell) syndrome and other conditions caused by the same missing part of chromosome 22. But features may vary slightly.
Medical problems commonly related to 22q11.2 deletion syndrome include heart problems, lowered immunity, a cleft palate, complications from low levels of calcium, various eye issues and autoimmune disorders. Complications also include hearing loss, skeletal differences, kidney and genital differences, and delayed development with behavioral and emotional problems.
The number and severity of symptoms related to 22q11.2 deletion syndrome vary. But specialists in various fields need to treat almost everyone with this syndrome.","Symptoms of DiGeorge syndrome can vary based on what body systems are affected and the severity of the problems. Some symptoms may be clear at birth, but others may not appear until later in infancy or as a young child, or as an adult. | Symptoms of DiGeorge syndrome may include: | Heart issues, such as problems with the structure of the heart and vessels, or a heart murmur and bluish skin because of poor circulation of blood, also known as cyanosis. | Frequent infections. | Distinctive facial features, such as an underdeveloped chin, ears that look different, wide-set eyes, hooded eyes and an enlarged nose tip. Asymmetric crying facies also may be present. This is when muscles on one side of the mouth don't develop fully, causing that side of the mouth to droop when crying, though the face looks balanced at rest. | A gap in the roof of the mouth, also known as a cleft palate, or other problems with the palate. | A hard time feeding, failure to gain weight or stomach problems. | Hearing loss. | Poor muscle tone. | Kidney problems. | Poor vision and other eye problems. | Low levels of calcium in the blood. | Scoliosis. | Other symptoms may include: | Delayed growth. | Delayed development, such as delays in rolling over, sitting up or other infant milestones. | Delayed speech development or nasal-sounding speech. | Learning delays or disabilities. | Behavioral problems. | Other conditions may cause symptoms like 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. It's important to get the right diagnosis quickly if your child shows any symptoms listed above. | Healthcare professionals may suspect 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: | At birth.If a severe heart problem, cleft palate or other signs typical of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are clear at birth, tests likely will be done before your child leaves the hospital. | At well-baby visits.Illnesses or conditions that are typical of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome may become clear over time.

Ventricular tachycardia,"Ventricular tachycardia is a type of irregular heartbeat, called an arrhythmia. It starts in the lower chambers of the heart, called the ventricles. This condition also may be called V-tach or VT.
A healthy heart typically beats about 60 to 100 times a minute at rest. In ventricular tachycardia, the heart beats faster, usually 100 or more beats a minute.
Sometimes the rapid heartbeat stops the heart chambers from properly filling with blood. The heart may not be able to pump enough blood to the body. If this happens, you may feel short of breath or lightheaded. Some people lose consciousness.
Ventricular tachycardia episodes may be brief and last only a few seconds without causing harm. But episodes lasting more than a few seconds, called sustainedV-tach, can be life-threatening. Sometimes ventricular tachycardia can cause all heart activity to stop. This complication is called sudden cardiac arrest.
Treatments for ventricular tachycardia include medicines, a shock to the heart, a heart device, and a procedure or surgery.","When the heart beats too fast, it may not send enough blood to the rest of the body. So the organs and tissues may not get enough oxygen. Symptoms of ventricular tachycardia are due to a lack of oxygen. They may include: | Chest pain, called angina. | Dizziness. | Pounding heartbeat, called palpitations. | Lightheadedness. | Shortness of breath. | Ventricular tachycardia can be a medical emergency even if your symptoms are minor. | Ventricular tachycardia, sometimes called V-tach or VT, is grouped according to how long an episode lasts. | NonsustainedV-tachstops on its own within 30 seconds. Brief episodes may not cause any symptoms. | SustainedV-tachlasts more than 30 seconds.

Vertebral tumor,"A vertebral tumor is a growth of cells that happens in the bones of the spine. A vertebral tumor also is called a spinal tumor. The bones of the spine are called the vertebrae. The spine is made up of many small vertebrae stacked on top of one another. The vertebrae hold the body upright. They enclose and protect the spinal cord.
Vertebral tumors can be cancerous or not cancerous. A noncancerous vertebral tumor also is called a benign vertebral tumor. Vertebral tumors that are cancerous are called malignant vertebral tumors.
Most malignant vertebral tumors are caused by cancer that starts somewhere else in the body and spreads to the spine. Cancer that spreads from an organ to another part of the body is called metastatic cancer. Cancers that affect the blood cells and bone marrow also can cause malignant vertebral tumors.
Vertebral tumors that start in the bones of the spine and haven't spread from somewhere else are rare. Another name for these tumors is primary bone tumors.
Treatment for vertebral tumors includes surgery, radiation therapy and medicines, including chemotherapy. Small and slow-growing vertebral tumors might not need treatment right away. The treatment that's best for your vertebral tumor depends on your situation. Your healthcare team considers the type of tumor you have, whether it is cancerous and its location within the spine.","Signs and symptoms of vertebral tumors include: | Back pain in the area of the tumor. | Back pain that radiates or shoots from the back to a nearby area. | Back pain that's worse at night. | Changes in sensation, such as numbness or a feeling of pins and needles. | Loss of the ability to move part of the body. | Loss of control over the bladder and bowels. | Muscle weakness.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vertebral-tumor/symptoms-causes/syc-20350123
Vesicoureteral reflux,"Vesicoureteral (ves-ih-koe-yoo-REE-tur-ul) reflux means that some urine flows in the wrong direction once it reaches the bladder. It flows back up tubes called ureters that connect the kidneys to the bladder. Typically, urine flows from the kidneys through the ureters down to the bladder. It's not supposed to flow back up.
Most often, vesicoureteral reflux is found in infants and children. Some are born with vesicoureteral reflux due to an issue with the structure of one of the two ureters. Others develop the condition later for reasons such as the bladder not being able to empty fully.
With vesicoureteral reflux, urine can carry germs from the bladder up to the kidneys. That raises the risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs).UTIscan happen in any of the organs that make urine and remove it from the body. These infections can cause symptoms such as a strong need to urinate and pain while urinating. Without treatment,UTIscan lead to kidney damage.
Some children who are born with vesicoureteral reflux outgrow it. Others need treatment such as medicine or surgery. The goal of treatment is to prevent kidney damage and moreUTIs.","Vesicoureteral reflux symptoms often are due to a urinary tract infection (UTI). AUTIdoesn't always cause symptoms, but most people notice some. | These symptoms can include: | A strong, constant urge to urinate. | A burning feeling when urinating. | The need to pass small amounts of urine often. | Cloudy urine. | Fever. | Pain in the side, groin or stomach area. | Babies and some small children withUTIscan't tell adults what their symptoms feel like. But they may have: | A fever for no clear reason. | Lack of hunger. | Fussiness. | As a child gets older, vesicoureteral reflux that doesn't get treated can lead to: | Bed-wetting. | Constipation or loss of control over bowel movements. | High blood pressure. | Protein in urine. | Urgent need to urinate or urinating more often than usual. | Leaking urine by accident, also called urinary incontinence. | Another symptom of vesicoureteral reflux is swelling of one or both kidneys. This swelling is called hydronephrosis. It's caused by the backup of urine into the kidneys.

Vocal cord paralysis,"Vocal cord paralysis is a condition that causes the loss of control of the muscles that control the voice. It happens when the nerve impulses to the voice box, also called the larynx, are disrupted. This results in paralysis of the vocal cord muscles.
Vocal cord paralysis can make it hard to speak and even breathe. The vocal cords, also called vocal folds, do more than just produce sound. They also protect the airway. They prevent food, drink and even saliva from entering the windpipe and causing a person to choke.
Possible causes of vocal cord paralysis include nerve damage during surgery, viral infections and certain cancers. Treatment for vocal cord paralysis usually involves surgery, and sometimes voice therapy.","Vocal cord paralysis usually involves the loss of control of only one vocal cord. Paralysis of both vocal cords is a rare but serious condition. This can make it hard to speak and can cause trouble with breathing and swallowing. | The vocal cords are two flexible bands of muscle tissue that sit at the entrance to the windpipe, also known as the trachea. When speaking, the bands come together and vibrate to make sound. The rest of the time, the vocal cords are relaxed in an open position so that you can breathe. | Symptoms of vocal cord paralysis may include: | A breathy quality to the voice. | Hoarseness. | Noisy breathing. | Shortness of breath. | Loss of vocal pitch. | Choking or coughing while swallowing food, drink or saliva. | The need to take several breaths while speaking. | Inability to speak loudly. | Loss of a gag reflex. | Ineffective coughing. | Frequent throat clearing.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vocal-cord-paralysis/symptoms-causes/syc-20378873

Neurofibromatosis type 1,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic condition that causes changes in skin pigment and tumors on nerve tissue. Skin changes include flat, light brown spots and freckles in the armpits and groin. Tumors can grow anywhere in the nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord and nerves. NF1 is rare. About 1 in 2,500 is affected by NF1.
The tumors often are not cancerous, known as benign tumors. But sometimes they can become cancerous. Symptoms often are mild. But complications can occur and may include trouble with learning, heart and blood vessel conditions, vision loss, and pain.
Treatment focuses on supporting healthy growth and development in children and early management of complications. If NF1 causes large tumors or tumors that press on a nerve, surgery can reduce symptoms. A newer medicine is available to treat tumors in children, and other new treatments are being developed.","Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) usually is diagnosed during childhood. Symptoms are seen at birth or shortly afterward and almost always by age 10. Symptoms tend to be mild to moderate, but they can vary from person to person. | Symptoms include: | Flat, light brown spots on the skin, known as cafe au lait spots.These harmless spots are common in many people. But having more than six cafe au lait spots suggests NF1. They often are present at birth or appear during the first years of life. After childhood, new spots stop appearing. | Freckling in the armpits or groin area.Freckling often appears by ages 3 to 5. Freckles are smaller than cafe au lait spots and tend to occur in clusters in skin folds. | Tiny bumps on the iris of the eye, known as Lisch nodules.These nodules can't easily be seen and don't affect vision. | Soft, pea-sized bumps on or under the skin called neurofibromas.These benign tumors usually grow in or under the skin but can also grow inside the body. A growth that involves many nerves is called a plexiform neurofibroma. Plexiform neurofibromas, when located on the face, can cause disfigurement. Neurofibromas may increase in number with age. | Bone changes.Changes in bone development and low bone mineral density can cause bones to form in an irregular way. People with NF1 may have a curved spine, known as scoliosis, or a bowed lower leg. | Tumor on the nerve that connects the eye to the brain, called an optic pathway glioma.This tumor usually appears by age 3. The tumor rarely appears in late childhood and among teenagers, and almost never in adults. | Learning disabilities.It's common for children with NF1 to have some trouble with learning. Often there is a specific learning disability, such as trouble with reading or math.

Vulvar cancer,"Vulvar cancer is cancer that starts as a growth of cells on the vulva. The vulva is the area of skin that surrounds the urethra and vagina. It includes the clitoris and labia.
Vulvar cancer commonly forms as a lump or sore on the vulva that often causes itching. Though it can happen at any age, vulvar cancer is usually diagnosed in older adults.
Vulvar cancer treatment often starts with surgery to remove the cancer and a small amount of surrounding healthy tissue. Sometimes vulvar cancer surgery requires removing the entire vulva. The earlier vulvar cancer is diagnosed, the less likely an extensive surgery is needed for treatment.","Signs and symptoms of vulvar cancer may include: | A lump, wartlike bump or an open sore on the vulva. | Bleeding in the genital area that isn't from menstruation. | Itching of the skin of the vulva that doesn't go away. | Pain and tenderness that affects the vulva. | Skin changes, such as changes in the color of the skin of the vulva or thickening of the skin.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vulvar-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20368051

In Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, some white blood cells undergo changes that turn them into cancer cells. The cancer cells can build up in the spongy material inside the bones where blood cells are made. This material is called bone marrow. The cancer cells crowd healthy blood cells out of the bone marrow. Cancer cells also may build up in other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes and the spleen.
The cancer cells make a protein that can build up in the blood. Too much of the protein can reduce blood flow in the body and cause other problems.","Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia grows slowly. It might not cause symptoms for years. | When they happen, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia symptoms may include: | Fatigue. | Fever. | Weight loss. | Night sweats. | Numbness in the hands or feet. | Swollen lymph nodes. | A feeling of pain or fullness under the ribs on your left side, which may be caused by an enlarged spleen. | Easy bruising. | Bleeding nose or gums. | Headache. | Shortness of breath. | Changes in vision. | Confusion.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20359967

These are called the endocrine glands. The condition also can cause tumors in the small intestine and stomach. Another name for MEN 1 is Wermer's syndrome.
The endocrine gland tumors that form due to MEN 1 usually are not cancer. Most often, the tumors grow on the parathyroid glands, the pancreas and the pituitary gland. Some glands affected by MEN 1 also may release too many hormones. That can lead to other health concerns.
The extra hormones of MEN 1 can cause many symptoms. These symptoms may include tiredness, bone pain, broken bones, kidney stones, and ulcers in the stomach or intestines.
MEN 1 can't be cured. But regular testing can detect health concerns, and healthcare professionals can provide treatment as needed.

Whiplash is commonly caused by rear-end car crashes. But whiplash also can result from sports accidents, physical abuse and other types of traumas, such as a fall. Whiplash may be called a neck sprain or strain, but these terms also include other types of neck injuries.
Most people with whiplash get better within a few weeks by following a treatment plan that includes pain medicine and exercise. However, some people have long-lasting neck pain and other complications.","Symptoms of whiplash most often start within days of the injury. They may include: | Neck pain and stiffness. | Pain that gets worse with neck movement. | Loss of range of motion in the neck. | Headaches, most often starting at the base of the skull. | Tenderness or pain in the shoulder, upper back or arms. | Tingling or numbness in the arms. | Tiredness. | Dizziness. | Some people also have: | Blurred vision. | Ringing in the ears, called tinnitus. | Trouble sleeping. | Crankiness. | Trouble focusing. | Memory problems. | Depression.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/whiplash/symptoms-causes/syc-20378921

Acne,"Acne is a skin condition that occurs when your hair follicles become plugged with oil and dead skin cells. It causes whiteheads, blackheads or pimples. Acne is most common among teenagers, though it affects people of all ages.
Effective acne treatments are available, but acne can be persistent. The pimples and bumps heal slowly, and when one begins to go away, others seem to crop up.
Depending on its severity, acne can cause emotional distress and scar the skin. The earlier you start treatment, the lower your risk of such problems.","Acne signs vary depending on the severity of your condition: | Whiteheads (closed plugged pores) | Blackheads (open plugged pores) | Small red, tender bumps (papules) | Pimples (pustules), which are papules with pus at their tips | Large, solid, painful lumps under the skin (nodules) | Painful, pus-filled lumps under the skin (cystic lesions) | Acne usually appears on the face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acne/symptoms-causes/syc-20368047

Wilms tumor,"Wilms tumor is a rare kidney cancer that mainly affects children. Also known as nephroblastoma, it's the most common cancer of the kidneys in children. Wilms tumor most often affects children ages 3 to 4. It becomes much less common after age 5, but it can affect older children and even adults.
Wilms tumor mostly occurs in just one kidney. But it can sometimes be in both kidneys at the same time.
Over the years, progress in the diagnosis and treatment of Wilms tumor has greatly improved the prognosis for children with this disease. With treatment, the outlook for most children with Wilms tumor is good.","Symptoms of Wilms tumor vary a lot. Some children don't seem to have any symptoms. But others with Wilms tumor have one or more of these symptoms: | A mass in the stomach area that can be felt. | Swelling in the stomach area. | Pain in the stomach area. | Other symptoms might include: | Fever. | Blood in the urine. | Low red blood cell level, also known as anemia. | High blood pressure.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/wilms-tumor/symptoms-causes/syc-20352655
Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is a rare inherited condition that causes copper levels to build up in several organs, especially the liver, brain and eyes. Most people with Wilson's disease are diagnosed between the ages of 5 and 35. But younger and older people can be affected too.
Copper plays a key role in building healthy nerves, bones, collagen and the skin pigment melanin. You usually take in copper from the food you eat. Your liver produces a substance called bile that removes any extra copper.
But in people with Wilson's disease, copper isn't removed properly and instead builds up. Sometimes it can be life-threatening if it's not treated. When diagnosed early, Wilson's disease is treatable, and many people with the condition live normal lives.","Wilson's disease is present at birth, but symptoms don't appear until copper levels build up in the brain, liver, eyes or another organ. Symptoms vary based on the parts of your body the disease affects. | These symptoms can include: | Tiredness and loss of appetite. | A yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eye, known as jaundice. | Golden-brown or copper-colored rings around the irises of the eyes, known as Kayser-Fleischer rings. | Fluid buildup in the legs or stomach area. | Problems with speech, swallowing or physical coordination. | Depression, mood changes and personality changes. | Having a hard time falling asleep and staying asleep. | Uncontrolled movements or muscle stiffness.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/wilsons-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353251
Impacted wisdom teeth,"Wisdom teeth, the third molars at the back of the mouth, are the last adult teeth to come in. Most people have four wisdom teeth — two on the top and two on the bottom. When wisdom teeth become impacted, they don't have enough room to emerge or develop in the usual way.
Impacted wisdom teeth can cause pain, damage other teeth and lead to other dental problems. Sometimes they don't cause any problems. But because wisdom teeth are hard to clean, they may be more prone to tooth decay and gum disease than other teeth.
Impacted wisdom teeth that cause pain or other dental problems usually are taken out. Some dentists and oral surgeons also recommend taking out impacted wisdom teeth that don't cause symptoms to prevent future problems.","Impacted wisdom teeth don't always cause symptoms. But when an impacted wisdom tooth becomes infected, damages other teeth or causes other dental problems, you may have some of these symptoms: | Red or swollen gums. | Tender or bleeding gums. | Jaw pain. | Swelling around the jaw. | Bad breath. | An unpleasant taste in your mouth. | A hard time opening your mouth.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/wisdom-teeth/symptoms-causes/syc-20373808
Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome,"Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a heart condition present at birth. That means it's a congenital heart defect. People withWPWsyndrome have an extra pathway for signals to travel between the heart's upper and lower chambers. This causes a fast heartbeat. Changes in the heartbeat can make it harder for the heart to work as it should.
WPWsyndrome is fairly rare. Another name for it is preexcitation syndrome.
The episodes of fast heartbeats seen in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome usually aren't life-threatening. But serious heart problems can occur. Rarely, the syndrome may lead to sudden cardiac death in children and young adults.
Treatment ofWPWsyndrome may include special actions, medicines, a shock to the heart or a procedure to stop the irregular heartbeats.","The heart rate is the number of times the heart beats each minute. A fast heart rate is called tachycardia (tak-ih-KAHR-dee-uh). | The most common symptom of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a heart rate greater than 100 beats a minute. | InWPWsyndrome, the fast heartbeat can begin suddenly. It may last a few seconds or several hours. Episodes may occur during exercise or while at rest. | Other symptoms ofWPWsyndrome may depend on the speed of the heartbeat and the underlying heart rhythm disorder. | For example, the most common irregular heartbeat seen withWPWsyndrome is supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). During an episode ofSVT, the heart beats about 150 to 220 times a minute, but it can occasionally beat faster or slower. | Some people withWPWsyndrome also have a fast and chaotic heart rhythm disorder called atrial fibrillation. | In general, symptoms ofWPWsyndrome include: | Rapid, fluttering or pounding heartbeats. | Chest pain. | Difficulty breathing. | Dizziness or lightheadedness. | Fainting. | Fatigue. | Shortness of breath. | Anxiety.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20354626
Wrinkles,"Wrinkles are a natural part of aging. These lines and creases in the skin are most likely to form on skin that's often exposed to the sun, such as the face, neck, hands and forearms. Pollutants and smoking also speed the aging process. Using sunscreen every day and quitting smoking help prevent some wrinkling.
If your wrinkles bother you, many options are available to help smooth them or make them less visible. These include medicines, skin-resurfacing techniques, fillers and surgery.","Wrinkles are the lines and creases that form in your skin. Some wrinkles become deep and may be especially noticeable around the eyes, mouth and neck.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/wrinkles/symptoms-causes/syc-20354927
Broken wrist,"A broken wrist is a break or crack in one or more of the bones of your wrist. The most common of these injuries occurs in the wrist when people try to catch themselves during a fall and land hard on an outstretched hand.
You may be at higher risk of a broken wrist if you participate in sports like in-line skating or snowboarding, or if you have a condition in which bones become thinner and more fragile (osteoporosis).
It's important to treat a broken wrist as soon as possible. Otherwise, the bones might not heal in proper alignment, which might affect your ability to do everyday activities, such as writing or buttoning a shirt. Early treatment will also help minimize pain and stiffness.","A broken wrist might cause these signs and symptoms: | Severe pain that might worsen when gripping or squeezing or moving your hand or wrist | Swelling | Tenderness | Bruising | Obvious deformity, such as a bent wrist",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-wrist/symptoms-causes/syc-20353169
Wrist pain,"Wrist pain is often caused by sprains or fractures from sudden injuries. But wrist pain also can result from long-term problems, such as repetitive stress, arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome.
Because so many factors can lead to wrist pain, diagnosing the exact cause can be difficult. But an accurate diagnosis is essential for proper treatment and healing.","Wrist pain may vary, depending on the cause. For example, osteoarthritis pain often is described as being similar to a dull toothache. Carpal tunnel syndrome usually causes a pins and needles feeling. This tingling sensation often occurs in the thumb and index and middle fingers, especially at night. The precise location of wrist pain also provides clues to what's behind the symptoms.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/wrist-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20366213
Dry skin,"Dry skin makes the skin look and feel rough, itchy, flaky or scaly. The location where these dry patches form vary from person to person. It's a common condition that affects people of all ages.
Dry skin, also known as xerosis or xeroderma, has many causes, including cold or dry weather, sun damage, harsh soaps, and overbathing.
You can do a lot on your own to improve dry skin, including moisturizing and practicing sun protection year-round. Try various products and skin care routines to find an approach that works for you.","Dry skin is often temporary or seasonal — you might get it only in winter, for example — or you might need to treat it long term. Signs and symptoms of dry skin might vary based on your age, health status, skin tone, living environment and sun exposure. They include: | A feeling of skin tightness | Skin that feels and looks rough | Itchiness (pruritus) | Slight to severe flaking skin, which causes the ashy look that can affect dry brown and black skin | Slight to severe scaling or peeling | Cracked ""dry riverbed"" look to leg | Fine lines or cracks | Skin that ranges from reddish on white skin to grayish on brown and black skin | Deep cracks that may bleed",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dry-skin/symptoms-causes/syc-20353885
Dry mouth,"Dry mouth, also called xerostomia (zeer-o-STOE-me-uh), is when the salivary glands in the mouth don't make enough saliva to keep the mouth wet. Dry mouth often is due to aging, the side effects of certain medicines or radiation therapy for cancer. Less often, a condition directly affecting the salivary glands can cause dry mouth. You also may experience dry mouth temporarily if you are thirsty or feel anxious about something.
For some people, dry mouth is only annoying. For others, dry mouth can greatly affect general health and the health of teeth and gums. Also, it can affect how much people eat and how much they enjoy what they eat.
Treatment for dry mouth depends on the cause.","If you're not producing enough saliva, you may notice these symptoms all or most of the time: | Dryness or a feeling of stickiness in your mouth. | Saliva that seems thick and stringy. | Bad breath. | Having a hard time chewing, speaking and swallowing. | Dry or sore throat and hoarseness. | Dry or grooved tongue. | A changed sense of taste. | Problems wearing dentures. | Lipstick stuck to teeth. | Saliva helps prevent tooth decay by washing away sugar and food particles and making bacteria neutral and less harmful. When you don't have enough saliva, you may find it harder to taste, chew and swallow. You also may have a hard time digesting food.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dry-mouth/symptoms-causes/syc-20356048

Yeast infection (vaginal),"A vaginal yeast infection is a fungal infection. It causes irritation, discharge and itching of the vagina and the vulva. Vaginal yeast infection also is called vaginal candidiasis.
Vaginal yeast infection affects most people assigned female at birth at some point in life. Many have at least two infections.
People who don't have sex can get a vaginal yeast infection. So it isn't though of as a sexually transmitted infection. But you can get vaginal yeast infections through sex.
There's a higher risk of vaginal yeast infection when you start having sex. And some vaginal yeast infections may be linked to sexual contact between the mouth and genital area, called oral-genital sex.
Medicines can treat vaginal yeast infections. Yeast infections that happen four times or more a year may need a longer treatment course and a plan to prevent them.","Yeast infection symptoms range from mild to moderate. They may include: | Itching and irritation in the vagina and tissues at the vaginal opening, called the vulva. | A burning feeling, mainly during intercourse or while urinating. | Redness and swelling of the vulva. Redness may be harder to see on Black or brown skin than on white skin. | Vaginal pain and soreness. | Thick, white vaginal shedding of fluid and cells, called discharge, with little or no odor.

Plague is a rare disease. The illness mostly occurs in only a few countries around the world. In the United States, plague affects a few people each year in rural or semirural areas of western states.
Plague usually can be treated with antibiotics. If not treated, the illness is often deadly.
Plague is considered a potential bioweapon. The U.S. government has plans and treatments in place if the disease is used as a weapon.",There are three types of plague. The symptoms vary for each type.,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/plague/symptoms-causes/syc-20351291
Yips,"The yips are involuntary wrist spasms that occur most commonly when golfers are trying to putt. However, the yips also can affect people who play other sports — such as cricket, darts and baseball.
It was once thought that the yips were always associated with performance anxiety. However, it now appears that some people have the yips due to a neurological condition affecting specific muscles. This condition is known as focal dystonia.
Changing the way you perform the affected task might help you find relief from the yips. For example, a right-handed golfer might try putting left-handed.","The most common symptom associated with the yips is an involuntary muscle jerk, although some people experience tremors, twitches, spasms or freezing.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/yips/symptoms-causes/syc-20379021
Zenker's diverticulum,"In Zenker's diverticulum, a bulge or pouch forms at the top of the tube that connects the throat to the stomach, called the esophagus. The condition is not common. Connected bands of muscle that work to pass food from the mouth to the stomach make up the esophagus.
Over time, the bulge of Zenker's diverticulum can get bigger. Food, pills and even thick mucus can get stuck in the pouch instead of going through the esophagus. This can lead to problems with eating and other complications.
The cause of Zenker's diverticulum is not known. It happens most often to men older than 60. Treatment for symptoms of Zenker's diverticulum often is surgery.","A small Zenker's diverticulum may not have any symptoms. But the bulge may get bigger over time. It can trap food, mucus and pills. Symptoms might include: | Trouble swallowing, called dysphagia. | Burping. | A gurgling noise at the back of the throat. | Coughing. | Hoarseness. | Bad breath. | Choking. | If the pouch gets big enough, what's in it may spill into the throat. Then Zenker's diverticulum symptoms might include: | Feeling of food stuck in the throat. | Coughing up or spitting up food 1 to 2 hours after eating. This is called regurgitation. | Breathing food into the lungs, called aspirating.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/zenkers-diverticulum/symptoms-causes/syc-20568839
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome,"Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is a condition in which one or more tumors grow in the pancreas or small intestine. The tumors, called gastrinomas, produce large amounts of the hormone gastrin. Gastrin causes the stomach to produce too much acid, which leads to peptic ulcers. High gastrin levels also can cause diarrhea, belly pain and other symptoms.
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is rare. Though it may happen at any time in life, people usually find out they have it sometime between ages 20 and 50. Medicines to cut down stomach acid and heal the ulcers are the usual treatment. Some people also may need surgery to remove tumors.","Symptoms of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome may include: | Stomach pain. | Diarrhea. | Burning, aching or discomfort in your upper belly. | Acid reflux and heartburn. | Burping. | Nausea and vomiting. | Bleeding in your digestive tract. | Losing weight without trying. | Loss of appetite.",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/zollinger-ellison-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20379042
